## Challenge
A weight `$A$` is tethered to a pole by a stiff rod with distance `$r$` away from the axis of rotation. The rod is tethered at the origin which is located on the axis of rotation at a vertical displacement (z-axis) of length `$r$` from the weight.

If the angular velocity is 2 rad/s `$\hat{k}$` and `$r = 3/\sqrt{2}$` meters, what is the linear velocity of the weight `$A$`?
