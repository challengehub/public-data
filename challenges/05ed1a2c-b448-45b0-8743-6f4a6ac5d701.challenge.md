## Comments
2D fourier transforms primarily come up in relation to images. The extention from 1D to 2D is fairly straightforward, and this challenge is designed to give you a basic understanding of the transition to multiple dimensions.

*Note: Discrete-Time Fourier Transforms are mentioned briefly in the video resource below. This is not something we have time to cover in this course so you may ignore that part of the video. Also, we have not really discussed the inverse DFT and we will not cover this in this course apart from a programming perspective.*


## Challenge
1. Relate the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform shown in the video to the 1D DFT you are already familiar with. What has changed?

2. What is meant by a two-dimensional basis function? Draw an example of a 2D basis function and describe its relation to the 2D DFT.
