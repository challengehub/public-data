## Challenge
Japan imports substantial amounts of LNG which is a mixture of the following gases:

    Liquid          |   Mol %   |
    ----------------|-----------|
    Methane         |   93.5    |
    Ethane          |    4.6    |
    Propane         |    1.2    |
    Carbon dioxide  |    0.7    |
    
The masses of Methane, Ethane, Propane and Carbon Dioxide are 16, 30, 44 and 44 g/mol respectively.

Assuming ideal gases, calculate the **average molecular mass of the mixture**.
