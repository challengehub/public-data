title: Finding the harmonic conjugate of u(x,y)=x^2 - y^2

---

## Comment
I recommend working through the example given in the chapter in the book.

## Challenge
Verify that `$u(x,y)$` is harmonic and find its harmonic conjugate `$v(x,y)$`. Then use the supplied solution for `$f(z)$` to determine the value of the integration constant of `$v(x,y)$`. 

`$$u(x,y)=x^2 - y^2$$` given `$f(1+i)=-3i$`.

## Resources
- Chapter 3.3 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan, 1st edition


## Solution Form
To check your answer, substitute `$x=2$` and `$y=3$` into your final expression for `$v$` and enter the value of `$v$`.
