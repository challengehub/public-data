title: Understanding Re and Im parts of complex numbers

---

## Comments
Our first step is to make sure that there is no confusion when calculating with complex numbers.


## Challenge
Let `$z = x + iy$`. Write the expressions in terms of `$x$` and `$y$`.
   a) Re`$(z^2)$`
   b) Im`$(1/z)$`
   c) Re`$(iz)$`
   d) Im`$(\bar{z}/z)$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan, chapter 1.1


## Solution Form
Enter the sum of all answers (a-d) assuming that `$x=2$` and `$y=3$`.
If your sum is complex in the form `$\alpha + i \beta$`, enter the number `$\alpha + \beta$`.
