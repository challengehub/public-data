## Comments
The period of a signal can be something other than 1. In fact, when moving from Fourier series to Fourier transforms this will become all the more important. The resource below gives the intuition behind the non-periodic case for complex Fourier series. For trigonometric Fourier series, the Fourier coefficients become:

`$$ a_k = \frac{2}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) \cos(2 \pi k t/T) dt $$`

`$$ b_k = \frac{2}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) \sin(2 \pi k t/T) dt $$`

while for complex Fourier series the Fourier coefficients become:
`$$ c_k = \frac{1}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) e^{-i 2 \pi kt/T} dt $$`

It is important that you appreciate how to incorporate the change in period length into any calculation of Fourier series that you perform.

*Note: It is very easy to make mistakes during the calculation. The most efficient way to do this is to check every step of your calculation before moving on to the next step.* 


## Challenge
Obtain an expression for the exponential Fourier series for the pulsing sawtooth function
`$$
    f(t)=
    \begin{cases}
        t & \text{for } 0<t<\frac{1}{4} \\
        0 & \text{for } \frac{1}{4}<t<\frac{1}{2}
    \end{cases}
$$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1.6 of the book https://see.stanford.edu/materials/lsoftaee261/book-fall-07.pdf


## Solution Form
You should find the `$c_k$`'s for `$k \ne 0$` are

`$$ \frac{i \pi k e^{-i \pi k} + e^{-i \pi k} - 1}{8 \pi^2 k^2} $$`

To mark the challenge as attempted, please just rate the difficulty of understanding how to do this.
