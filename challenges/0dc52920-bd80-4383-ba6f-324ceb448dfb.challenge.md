## Intro

In the change of basis challenge we have seen how to translate from one coordinate system to another. Also the difference between the standard basis and the standard coordinate system became clear.  In this challenge we take a look at the standard matrix `$[T]$` of a linear transformation `$T$` and its close relation to standard basis. We then introduce the matrix `$[T]_{\mathcal B}$` of  linear transformation `$T$` with respect to a basis `$\mathcal B$`.  



## Terminology

- standard matrix of linear transformation
- matrix of linear transformation with respect to a basis `$\mathcal B$`
 

## Theorems

- properties of the matrix of linear transformation with respect to a basis `$\mathcal B$`
- matrix of composition of linear transformations
- matrix of the inverse of linear transformation



## Key points

- to be able to change the standard matrix to a matrix with respect to a given basis
- to be able to find the matrix of composition and inverse effectively




## Challenge

1.  Find the matrix `$[T]_{\mathcal B}$` of the linear transformation `$T$` with respect to the 
basis `$\mathcal B$`.

    a) `$T:\mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$` stretches a vector by a factor `$2$` in the `$x$`-component and a factor `$3$` in the `$y$`-component,  `$\mathcal B = \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ -1 \end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1\end{array}\right]\right\}$`

    b) `$T:\mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$` is the transformation that rotates each point `$90$` degrees counterclockwise,  `$\mathcal B = \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right]\right\}$`

    c) `$T:\mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$` is the reflection in the line `$y = -x$`,  `$\mathcal B = \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{c} -1\\ 1 \end{array}\right]\right\}$`


2. Find the matrix of `$S\circ T$` with respect to `$\mathcal B =  \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ -1 \end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{c} -1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right]\right\} $` using a theorem from lecture notes when
`$$ T \left[\begin{array}{c} a \\ b \end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} b  \\ -a \end{array}\right] \ {\rm and }\ 
 S \left[\begin{array}{c} a \\ b \end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} a+2b  \\ a -b \end{array}\right].$$`

3. If you can, use a theorem from lecture notes to find the matrix of `$T^{-1}$` with respect to `$\mathcal B = \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ -1 \end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 1\end{array}\right]\right\} $` for the linear transformation `$ T \left[\begin{array}{c} a \\ b \end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} a+3b  \\ a-b \end{array}\right]$`.

## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing than from an immediate explanation.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however it is a waste of time for everybody if you do not aim higher.
