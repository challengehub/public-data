## Terminology 
- imaginary unit
- complex number
- real part, imaginary part, pure imaginary number
- equality of complex numbers
- arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- properties of arithmetic operations (commutative law, associative law, distributive law)
- zero and unity
- complex conjugate, its properties and relation to real and imaginary part
- inverses (additive, multiplicative, reciprocal)

## Comments

Our first step is to make sure that there is no confusion when calculating with complex numbers.

## Challenge



1.  Calculate

    a) `$i^{8}$`,   `$i^{35}$`,  `$i^{137}$`

    b) `$(1+i)^5$`, `$(1+i)^{5404}$`

2. Write the given number in the form `$a+ ib$`.

   a)  `$i(4-i) + 4i(1+2i)$`

   b) `$(2-3i)(4+i)$`

   c) `$\displaystyle \frac{2-4i}{3+5i}$`

   d) `$\displaystyle \frac{(4+5i)+2i^3}{(2+i)^2}$`

   e) `$\displaystyle (2+3i) \left(\frac{2-i}{1+2i}\right)^2$`
3. Let `$z = x + iy$`. Write the expressions in terms of `$x$` and `$y$`.
   a) Re`$(z^2)$`
   b) Im`$(1/z)$`
   c) Re`$(iz)$`
   d) Im`$(\bar{z}/z)$`

## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
