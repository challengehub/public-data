## Terminology 
- imaginary unit
- complex number
- real part, imaginary part, pure imaginary number
- equality of complex numbers
- arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- properties of arithmetic operations (commutative law, associative law, distributive law)
- zero and unity
- complex conjugate, its properties and relation to real and imaginary part
- inverses (additive, multiplicative, reciprocal)

## Comments

A first step is to make sure that elementary calculations with complex numbers become a second nature.  

## Challenge



1.  Calculate `$i^{137}$`
  

2. Let `$z_1 = 3 + 5i$` and `$z_2 = 2 - 3i$` and evaluate the following.
   a)  `$z_1 + z_2$`
   b) `$z_1 - z_2$`
   c) `$z_1 * z_2$`
   d) `$z_1 / z_2$`

3. Let `$z = x + iy$`. Write the expressions in terms of `$x$` and `$y$`.
   a) Re`$(z^2)$`
   b) Im`$(1/z)$`
   c) Re`$(iz)$`
   d) Im`$(\bar{z}/z)$`
