## Comments

A first step is to make sure that calculating with complex numbers becomes a second nature.  

## Challenge



1.  Calculate `$i^{137}$`
  

Let `$z_1 = 3 + 5i$` and `$z_2 = 2 - 3i$` and evaluate the following.

2.  `$z_1 + z_2$`
3.  `$z_1 - z_2$`
4.  `$z_1 * z_2$`
5.  `$z_1 / z_2$`

Let `$z = x + iy$`. Write the expressions in terms of `$x$` and `$y$`.
6.  Re`$(z^2)$`
7.  Im`$(1/z)$`
8.  Re`$(iz)$`
9.  Im`$(\bar{z}/z)$`
