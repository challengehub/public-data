## Challenge

Find the image of the given set under the principal square root mapping `$w = z^\frac12$`. Represent the mapping by drawing the set and its image.

a) the ray `${\rm arg}(z) = - \frac23 \pi$`

b) the arc `$|z| = 9$`, `$ -\frac\pi2 \leq {\rm arg}(z) \leq \pi$`
    
<!-- c) the parabola `$x = \frac{y^2}{10} - \frac52$`  -->
