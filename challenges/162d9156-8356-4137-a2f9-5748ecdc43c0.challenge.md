## Challenge
Consider the solution to the equation

`$$
    y''+5y'+4y=100e^{-2t}
$$`

given initial conditions `$y(0)=-1$` and `$y'(0)=0$`.

The homogeneous solution to this equation is
`$$
    y(t)= \frac{1}{3} \left( e^{-4t} - 4 e^{-t} \right)
$$`
Show how the two graphs of the homogeneous and non-homogenous solutions differ, and explain how the forcing leads to the different shape observed.
