## Comments

The "damping" term is often used to describe damping of oscillations of a system; but it doesn't need to have that effect. Depending on it's value relative to the other terms, it can cause positive feedback leading to an exponentially-increasing solution with no chance for oscillation.

## Challenge

1. Solve the following 2nd-order differential equation that has real roots.

`$$ y'' − 3y' + 2y = 0 $$`

2. What is the effect of the damping term here?

## Solution
To check your answer for (1), solve for `$y(1)$` given initial conditions `$y(0) = 5$` and `$y'(0) = −8$`.

Please compare your answer for (2) with your partner in class.
