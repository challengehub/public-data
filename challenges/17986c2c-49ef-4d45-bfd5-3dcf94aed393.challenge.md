## Comments

Here we include a damping term again, but this time it is negative and this is enough to flip the sign of the roots.

## Challenge

1. Solve the following 2nd-order differential equation that has real roots.

y′′ − 3y′ + 2y = 0

2. What is the effect of the damping term here?

## Resources

- Book (http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/getfile.aspx?file=B,1,N) from page 118.

## Solution

Please compare your answer for (2) with your partner or the teacher in class.

To check your answer for (1), solve for y(1) given initial conditions y(0) = 5 and y′(0) = −8.
