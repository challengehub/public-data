title: Numerical solution of an ODE using a computer

---

## Comment

In many cases you'll need to solve ODE's computationally rather than by hand. This challenge gives you the opporunity to try that.

## Challenge
Consider the highly non-linear ODE:

`$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \sin^2(xy) + e^{-y} - x$$`

Given initial conditions `$x=1$` and `$y=2$`, use computational numerical integration to determine the value of `$y(100)$`.

## Solution Form
Enter the value you obtain.
