## Challenge
A weight `$A$` is tethered to a pole by a stiff rod with distance `$r$` away from the axis of rotation. The rod is tethered at the origin which is located on the pole at a vertical displacement (z-axis) of length `$r$` from the weight. `$A$` is situated in the x-z plane.

If the angular velocity is 2 rad/s `$\hat{k}$` and `$r = 3/\sqrt{2}$` meters, what is the magnitude of the **tangential acceleration**?

*Correction to book: Figure 7/9 should read `$\bm{\alpha} = \bm{\dot{\omega}} = \bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{\omega}$` (not `$\bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{r}$`)*
