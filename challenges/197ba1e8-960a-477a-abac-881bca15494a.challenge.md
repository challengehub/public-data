## Challenge
Determine the cross product `$\bm{f} = \bm{d} \times \bm{e}$` where

`$\bm{d} = 4 \hat{i}+ 2 \hat{j} + 1 \hat{k}$` and

`$\bm{e} = -2 \hat{i} -4 \hat{j} + 8 \hat{k}$`

*without* calculating the angle between them.

## Solution Form
Your final answer will be a vector `$a \hat{i} + b \hat{j} + c \hat{k}$`. To check your answer, enter the value of `$a+b+c$`.
