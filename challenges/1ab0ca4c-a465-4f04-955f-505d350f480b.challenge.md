## Intro

Complex integration is defined in a way similar to the line integral for real functions.




## Terminology

- parametrization of a curve in the complex plane
- smooth, piecewise smooth, simple, closed curves in the complex plane
- contour, path 
- positive/negative orientation orientation of a curve, opposite curve


## Theorems

- integration of a complex-valued function of a real variable
- evaluation of contour integral
- properties (basic algebra) of contour integrals
- bounding theorem
- parametrization of contours is not unique







## Comments

Try to understand the steps leading to definitions of the complex integral. The main point of this challenge is to learn how to evaluate contour integrals through integration of  a complex-valued functions of a real variable. 



## Challenge

1. Evaluate the given integral along the indicated contour `$C$`.

   a) `$\displaystyle{\int_C (2z + 3)} dz$`, where `$C : z(t) = t + it^2, 0 \leq t \leq 2$`
   
   b) `$\displaystyle{\int_C |z|^2 } dz$`, where `$C$` is the straight line from `$z=-1+i$` to `$z=1$`
   
   c) `$\displaystyle{\int_C (3\bar{z} + i) }dz$`, where `$C$` is the top half of the unit circle from `$z=1$` to `$z=-1$`
   
   d) `$\displaystyle{\oint_C {\rm Re}(z) }dz$`, where `$C$` is the circle `$|z| = 1$`
   
   e) `$\displaystyle{\oint_C z e^z} dz$`, where `$C$` is the square with vertices `$ z=0$`, `$z=1$`, `$z = 1 + i$` and `$ z= i$`
   
   
2. Calculate the length of the indicated curve.

   a) `$z(t) = t^2 + it^3, \hspace{0.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq 2$`
   
   b) `$z(t) = 2e^{it}, \hspace{0.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$`
   
3. Find upper bound for the absolute value of `$\displaystyle \oint_C \frac{e^z}{z^2 + 1} dz$` along the circle `$C = \{z: |z| = 5\}$`.
