## Comments
When decomposing a higher-order ODE into a system of 1st-order ODE's, we are actually dealing with a special form of 1st-order ODE system that looks like

`$$
     \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1' \\ x_2' \\ x_3' \\ x_4'
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
     \left(
        \begin{array}{cccc}
            0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
            -a_5/a_1 & -a_4/a_1 & -a_3/a_1 & -a_2/a_1
        \end{array}
    \right)
     \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4
        \end{array}
    \right)
    +
     \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ f(y)
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`

which naturally arise from a higher-order ODE like
`$$
    a_1 y'''' + a_2 y''' + a_3 y'' + a_4 y' + a_5 y = f(y)
$$`

There are some cases however where systems of ODE's cannot be expressed as a higher-order ODE. In this challenge you can learn about such systems.


## Challenge
Find the general solution for the system of equations
`$$
  \bm{x'} = \left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
      2 & 7 \\
      -5 & -10
    \end{array}
  \right) \bm{x}
$$`

## Solution Form

`$$

    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            7\\
            -5
        \end{array}
    \right)
    e^{-3t} + C_2
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            1\\
            -1
        \end{array}
    \right) e^{-5t}
$$`

or equivalent.
