## Challenge
Considering an air-water interface at equilibration where the relative humidity is 50% and the saturated water density is `$0.02~\text{kmol}/m^3$`.

Assuming an ideal gas, what is the mole-fraction of water vapour above the surface? You may assume a temperature of `$2\degree C$` and an atmospheric pressure of `$1~\text{atm}$`.
