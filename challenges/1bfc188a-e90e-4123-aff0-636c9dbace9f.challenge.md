title: Laplace transform of a short pulse function

---

## Comments
The Laplace Transform is a powerful technique for solving differential quations. The videos in the resources below provide an excellent explanation. The book goes into a little more depth and is recommended for more advanced understanding.

Remember: `$F(s) = \int_0^{\infty} f(t)e^{-st} \, dt$`

## Challenge
Calculate the Laplace transform for the 1-second pulse function represented by the graph below, having a value of zero everywhere except between `$t=1$` and `$t=2$` where it has a value of one.
