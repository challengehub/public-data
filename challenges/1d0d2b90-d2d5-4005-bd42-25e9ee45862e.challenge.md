title: The effect of a stretch in the time domain on the Fourier transform

---

## Challenge
<!-- 1. Show that the Fourier transform `$F_\text{stretch}(s)$` of a signal that underwent a stretch `$a$` in the time domain can be related to the Fourier transform of the original signal `$F_\text{orig}(s)$` through
`$$
F_\text{stretch}(s)=\frac{1}{|a|}F_\text{orig}(s/a)
$$`


2. --> 
Does a *stretching* of a signal in the time domain cause a *stretch* or a *squeeze* in the frequency domain?

Write a formula that justifies your choice mathematically.
