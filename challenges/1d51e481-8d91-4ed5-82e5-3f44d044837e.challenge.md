## Challenge

![Functions with and without damping](/api/v0/teachers/github.NanoScaleDesign/resources/public/d73270b1-2954-4bad-90df-52a691166b0d.jpeg/d73270b1-2954-4bad-90df-52a691166b0d.jpeg)

The 6 functions shown in the graph above may represent solutions of a 2nd-order differential equation `$Ay'' + By' + Cy = 0$`. Assuming `$A>0$` and `$C>0$`, place the solutions A-F in the order shown below.

**I.** Solution of a 2nd-order differential equation with real negative roots.

**II.** Solution of a 2nd-order differential equation with real positive roots.

**III.** Solution of a 2nd-order differential equation with equal roots.

**IV.** Solution of a 2nd-order differential equation with complex roots and B=0.

**V.** Solution of a 2nd-order differential equation with complex roots and positive damping.

**VI.** Solution of a 2nd-order differential equation with complex roots and negative damping.
