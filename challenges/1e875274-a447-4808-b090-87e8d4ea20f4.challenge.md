## Comments

Linear functions are the easiest type of functions to visualize in complex plane. On the other hand, they play a crucial role in the concept of limit and differentiation. We will be working with them a lot and hence a good understanding of them is a *must*. 

## Challenge
Express the  composition of magnification by `$2$`, translation by `$\sqrt2$` and then rotation through `$\frac \pi4$` as a linear mapping `$f(z) = az + b$`.

Maintain the order of transformations as they are described.

## Resources
    
- Chapter 2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
To check your solution, calculate `$f(z=\sqrt{2})$`.
You will obtain a solution `$a+ib$`.
Enter `$b$` to check your solution.
