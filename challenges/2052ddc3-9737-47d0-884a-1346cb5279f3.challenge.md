## Comments
One interesting application of 1st-order differential equations is that of population growth.


## Challenge
*Assuming there is no-limit on growth*, a given bacteria would be able to reproduce at such a rate that the amount of bacteria measured in mg increases by 20% every 25 hours. Derive an expression for the rate of growth in mg/h.

## Solution Form
To check your answer, calculate the rate of growth when there are 20 mg of bacteria.
*To ensure accuracy, you will need to maintain a large degree of precision during your calculations!*
