## Comments
You will need to become comfortable in working with different intervals and understanding why their integral goes to zero over that interval. Therefore in this challenge, be sure to ask yourself: why is the integral zero over this period and not another period?


## Challenge
Calculate the sum of `$a_1$` to `$a_4$` in the following equations. There will be multiple solutions for each `$a_k$`; take the smallest solution in each case.

`$$\int_0^{a_1} \sin(2 \pi t) dt = 0$$`

`$$\int_0^{a_2} \sin(t) dt = 0$$`

`$$\int_0^{a_3} \sin(2 t) dt = 0$$`

`$$\int_0^{a_4} \sin(t/2) dt = 0$$`
