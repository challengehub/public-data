## Challenge
1. Given that `$y(t)$` satisfies the equation `$y' = y^3 + 3t$` subject to `$y(1) = 2$`, find `$y'(1)$` without solving the differential equation and obtain the equation of the tangent to the curve `$y(t)$` at the point (1,2).

2. Use the tangent line to estimate the value at `$t = 1.5$`.
