title: Expressing complex linear mapping in terms of rotation, magnification and translation

---

## Comments

Linear functions are the easiest type of functions to visualize in complex plane. On the other hand, they play a crucial role in the concept of limit and differentiation. We will be working with them a lot and hence a good understanding of them is a *must*. 

## Challenge
Express the given linear mapping `$w = f(z)$` as a composition of a rotation, magnification, and a translation as in the formula
`$$
f(z)=a z+b=|a|\left(\frac{a}{|a|} z\right)+b
$$`

a) `$f(z) = 3iz+4$`
    
b) `$f(z) = -\frac12z + 1 - \sqrt{3} i$`


## Resources
    
- Chapter 2.3 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
For a cursory check, please enter the sum of the magnification terms for (a) and (b) together.
Then, please compare your answer with your partner in class.
