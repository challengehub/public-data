## Comments

Linear functions are the easiest type of functions to visualize in complex plane. On the other hand, they play a crucial role in the concept of limit and differentiation. We will be working with them a lot and hence a good understanding of them is a *must*. 

## Challenge
Express the given linear mapping `$w = f(z)$` as a composition of a rotation, magnification, and a translation as in formula (6) in chapter 2.3 in the textbook. Then describe the action of the linear mapping in words out loud to yourself (no need to write down the description in words).

a) `$f(z) = 3iz+4$`
    
b) `$f(z) = -\frac12z + 1 - \sqrt{3} i$`


## Resources
    
- Chapter 2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
For a cursory check, please enter the sum of the magnification terms for (a) and (b) together.
Then, please compare your answer with your partner in class.
