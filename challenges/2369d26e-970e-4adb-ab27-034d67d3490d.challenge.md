title: Show that Cauchy's integral formula can be re-written as a lower power

---

## Challenge

Show that Cauchy's integral formula

`$$ f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{n!}{2 \pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}} dz$$`

can be written in the form

`$$\oint_C \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^n} dz = 2 \pi i \frac{f^{(n-1)} (z_0)}{(n-1)!}$$`
