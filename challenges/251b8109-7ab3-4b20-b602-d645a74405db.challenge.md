title: Calculating the complex roots of (16i/(1+i))^(1/8)

---

## Comment
Let us make sure that everybody understands why the equation `$w^n = z$` has  exactly `$n$` solutions and how to find them. Here, `$n$` is a positive integer.

## Challenge
Compute the principal root and `$n$`th root of the following expression and sketch the roots `$w_0,w_1, \dots, w_{n-1}$` on an appropriate circle centered at the origin:
  
`$$ \left(\frac{16i}{1+i}\right)^\frac18$$`

## Solution Form
Your solution will be of the form `$\alpha + i \beta$`.
To check your answer enter `$\alpha + \beta$`  of the _1st root_ and please compare your graph with your partner in class.
