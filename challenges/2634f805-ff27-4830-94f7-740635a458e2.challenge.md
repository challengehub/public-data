## Challenge
What is the solubility `$\tilde{S}$` at standard temperature and pressure of a gas if it has a concentration of `$10^{-3}~\text{kmol}/\text{m}^3$` at a partial pressure of `$0.5 ~\text{bar}$`?


## Resources

- Section **14.5.2** of *Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer* by F. Incropera et. al., 7th edition


## Solution Form
Please enter your solution in units of `$(\text{m}^3~\text{gas, STP})/(\text{m}^3~\text{solid})/\text{(atm partial pressure gas)}$`.
Enter only the number, not the units.
