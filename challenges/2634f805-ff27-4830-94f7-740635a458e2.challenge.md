## Challenge
What volume will species *A* occupy in the gas-phase at standard temperature and pressure (STP) if it occupies `$20~\text{m}^3$` in the solid phase?


## Resources

- Section **14.5.2** of *Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer* by F. Incropera et. al., 7th edition


## Solution Form
Please enter your solution in units of `$(\text{m}^3~\text{gas})/(\text{m}^3~\text{solid})/\text{(atm partial pressure gas)}$`.
Enter only the number, not the units.
