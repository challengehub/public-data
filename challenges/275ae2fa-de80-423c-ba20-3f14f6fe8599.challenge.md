## Challenge
Consider a box of volume `$1m^3$`. The box contains 1 mole of gas. At time `$t=0$`, all the gas molecules in the left 1/4 of the box are labeled *A*. As time goes to `$t=\infty$`, what will the density of the molecules labeled *A* be in the right half of the box? Note that there is only 1 species of gas in the box.
