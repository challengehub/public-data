title: Diffusion in the long time limit

## Challenge
Consider a cuboid box of volume `$1m^3$`. The box contains 1 mole of gas. There is only 1 gas with 1 type of molecule in the box.

At time `$t=0$`, all the gas molecules in the left 1/4 of the box are labeled *A*. There is still only 1 type of molecule in the box, but now some of those molecules have label *A* and some do not.

As time goes to `$t=\infty$`, what will the density of the molecules labeled *A* be in the right half of the box?

## Resources

## Solution Form
Enter your solution in units of `$\text{moles} / m^3$`.
Only enter the number when checking your answer, not the units.
