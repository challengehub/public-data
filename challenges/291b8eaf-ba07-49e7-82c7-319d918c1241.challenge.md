title: Determining the Fourier Series coefficients of sin(x)

---

**(Optional challenge)** *If you have time I recommend that you complete this challenge for deep understanding, however you may skip this challenge if you do not have enough time*

## Challenge
*By inspection* (ie, not by applying formulas), by writing `$\sin(x)$` in exponential form, deduce the Fourier coefficients `$c_{-2}$`, `$c_{-1}$` and `$c_0$`.


## Solution Form
You wil end up with 3 complex numbers. To check your answer, enter the sum the magnitudes of the three coefficients. Also, please compare with your partner in class.
