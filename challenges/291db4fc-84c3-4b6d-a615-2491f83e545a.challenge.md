title: Analysis of the coefficients of the Discrete Fourier Transform

## Comments
Having identified the frequency spectrum, it is possible then to analyse the frequencies of the signal. The video listed in the resources below provides a nice introduction to help understand interpretation of the DFT coefficients resulting from analysis of a frequency spectrum. Note that it uses the "j" representation of imaginary numbers (instead of "i").

The video discusses the phase of the signal as the angle formed by rotating anti-clockwise from an arrow pointing in the positive direction along the real axis. Why start there? It's related to how a `$e^{it}$` function at `$t=0$` yields a value of `$1$`. Why go anti-clockwise? How does the value of `$e^{it}$` change as `$t$` increases from `$0$`?



## Challenge
Consider the sine curve shown here sampled 8 times per second:

![Sine curve with DFT points](/api/v0/teachers/github.NanoScaleDesign/resources/public/cc5ffdd0-830c-48a0-8e58-5e14e1abd7ca.jpeg/cc5ffdd0-830c-48a0-8e58-5e14e1abd7ca.jpeg)

Using an appropriate matrix `$F_8$` one can calculate a vector of DFT coefficients `$\hat{f}$`.

**By analysis of the resulting DFT coefficient vector** `$\hat{f}$`, determine the frequency (`$f$`), amplitude (`$a$`) and phase (`$p$`) of the sine-wave.
