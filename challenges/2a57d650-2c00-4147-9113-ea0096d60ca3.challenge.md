## Challenge
Considering the image below, a box rotates about the x-axis at a constant rate of `$\dot{\gamma} = 5 \pi$` rad/s. For the case where there is no rotation about the Z-axis (N=0), calculate the **acceleration** of point B on the disk as the angle `$\gamma = 60 \degree$` is passed and point B is at the top of the disk. The disk rotates at a speed of 180 rev/min in an anti-clockwise direction.

## Resources
- Section 7/1 to 7/5 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9cc7sSm_g

*Correction to book: Figure 7/9 should read `$\bm{\alpha} = \bm{\dot{\omega}} = \bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{\omega}$` (not `$\bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{r}$`)*

## Solution Form
Your answer will consist of a vector `$\alpha \bm{\hat{i}} + \beta \bm{\hat{j}} + \gamma \bm{\hat{k}}$` in units of `$m/s^2$`.
To check your answer, calculate `$\alpha + 2 \beta + 4 \gamma$`.
