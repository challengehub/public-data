## Challenge
Calculate the **acceleration** of point A in question 7/12 in the book.

## Resources
- Section 7/1 to 7/5 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9cc7sSm_g

*Correction to book: Figure 7/9 should read `$\bm{\alpha} = \bm{\dot{\omega}} = \bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{\omega}$` (not `$\bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{r}$`)*

## Solution Form
Your answer will consist of a vector `$\alpha \bm{\hat{i}} + \beta \bm{\hat{j}} + \gamma \bm{\hat{k}}$` in `$m/s^2$`.
To check your answer, calculate `$\alpha + 10 \beta + 100 \gamma$`.
