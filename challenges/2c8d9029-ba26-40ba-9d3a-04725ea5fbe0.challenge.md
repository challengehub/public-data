## Comments
Our first step is to make sure that there is no confusion when calculating with complex numbers.


## Challenge
1. Calculate `$(1+i)^5$`

2. Calculate `$(1+i)^{5404}$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
1. Enter your answer. If your answer is complex, in the form `$\alpha + i \beta$`, enter the number `$\alpha + \beta$`. Be sure to check your solution with your partner in class.
2. Please compare with your partner in class.
