title: Calculate the residue of sin(1/z) around the singularity 0

---

## Challenge
Given that the Taylor expansion of `$\sin(x)$` is

`$$\sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{z^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$`

Determine the residue of the Laurent series expansion around `$z_0=0$` for the function `$\sin(1/z)$`.
