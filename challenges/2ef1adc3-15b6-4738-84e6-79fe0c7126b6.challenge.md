## Challenge
**a)** Briefly explain what is meant by the moment of inertia. You may use an analogy to the linear case if this is helpful.

**b)** Consider a body with mass elements *dm* undergoing a rotational acceleration `$\alpha$`. Starting from your understanding of the velocity of a given mass element in the body `$\bm{v}_{dm} = \bm{\omega} \times \bm{r}$`, show that the moment of inertia is given by:

`$$I = \int r^2 dm$$`
