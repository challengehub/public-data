title: Showing that a complex function is continuous at z0

---

## Challenge
Show that the function `$f$` is continuous at the given point `$z_0$`.

a)  `$\displaystyle f(z) = z^3 - \frac1z$`; `$z_0 = 3i$`
   
b)  `$\displaystyle f(z) = \left\{ \displaystyle\begin{array}{cl}\displaystyle \frac{z^3 -1}{z-1} & |z| \ne 1 \\ 3 & |z| = 1 \end{array} \right. $`; `$ z_0 = 1$`
   
<!-- c) `$\displaystyle f(z) = \frac{{\rm Re}(z)}{z + iz} - 2z^2$`; `$ z_0 = e^{i \frac\pi4}$` -->
