title: Showing that the complex inverse sine function recovers real angles for real
  values

---

## Challenge
The formula for the inverse sine of a complex number is:
`$$\sin ^{-1} z=-i \ln \left[i z+\left(1-z^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}\right]$$`

By substituting a real number of your choosing, show that this formula recovers the expected real angle when `$z$` is completely real.
