## Comments

To understand the polar form of complex numbers better solve the following challenges. 

## Challenge

1. Find `$z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb C$` so that Arg`$(z_1z_2) =\not {\rm Arg}(z_1) + {\rm Arg}(z_2)$`

2. How are the complex numbers `$z_1$` and `$z_2$` related if arg`$(z_1) ={\rm arg }(z_2)$`?

3. Student A states that, even though she can't find it in the text, she thinks that 
   `${\rm arg}(\overline z) = - {\rm arg}(z)$`. For example, she says, if `$z = 1+i$`, then `$\overline z = 1-i$` and 
   arg`$(z) = \frac \pi 4$` and `${\rm arg}(\overline z)= - \frac \pi 4$`. Student B disagrees because he feels that he
   has a counterexample: If `$z =i$`, then `$\overline z = - i$`; we can take arg`$(i) = \frac\pi2$` and 
   arg`$(-i) = \frac{3\pi}2$` and so `${\rm arg}(i) =\not - {\rm arg}(-i)$`. Take sides and defend your position.

## Resources

- Check textbook

- Go back to previous challenges.

- Explore the Internet.

## Tips

- Statements like "This is obvious." or "I can see that ..." are not valid 
 arguments when dealing with a new problem. Make sure you clearly explain
 why things are obvious using elementary math truths!

- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
