## Comments

To understand the polar form of complex numbers better solve the following challenges. 

## Challenge

1. Find `$z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb C$` so that Arg`$(z_1z_2) \ne {\rm Arg}(z_1) + {\rm Arg}(z_2)$`

2. How are the complex numbers `$z_1$` and `$z_2$` related if arg`$(z_1) ={\rm arg }(z_2)$`?

3. Student A states that, even though she can't find it in the text, she shinks that `$arg(\overline z) = - {\rm arg}(z)$`. For example, she says, if `$z = 1+i$`, then `$\overline z = 1-i$` and arg`$(z) = \frac \pi 4$` and `${\rm arg}(\overline z)= - \frac \pi 4$`. Student B disagrees because he feels that he has a counterexample: If `$z =i$`, then `$\overline z = - i$`; we can take arg`$(i) = \frac\pi2$` and arg`$(-i) = \frac{3\pi}2$` and so `${\rm arg}(i) \neq {\rm arg}(-i)$`. Take sides and defend your position.

## Resources

- Check textbook

- Check the challenge "Polar form of complex numbers (basic)"

- Check the rest of the Internet.

## Tips

- Statements like "This is obvious." or "I can see that ..." are not valid arguments. Make sure you clearly explain why things are obvious!

- Strive for more than the required minimum! Find and solve more challenges to become really proficient.
