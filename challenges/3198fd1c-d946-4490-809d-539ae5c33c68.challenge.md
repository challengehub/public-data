## Comments
Fourier series involves the construction of a signal by summing multiple periodic signals and careful choice of each frequency's amplitude and phase. For example, considering the following 3 signals `$f_k(t)$`:

- `$f_1(t) = 2 \sin(2 \pi t)$`
- `$f_2(t) = 1 \sin(4 \pi t + \pi)$`
- `$f_3(t) = 0.3 \sin(6 \pi t + \pi/5)$`

Their sum produces a much more complex shape:

Here we will consider Fourier sine and cosine series. We will go beyond this description later, but you should be aware of their existance and a method of their derivation.


## Challenge
As shown above, a complex function (signal) can be made up of a sum of sine signals:

`$$f(t) = A_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \sin(2 \pi k t + \phi_k) \tag{1}$$`

Using basic trigonometric relations, show that this can be re-written in terms of a sum of sines and cosines:

`$$f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k \cos(2 \pi k t) + b_k \sin(2 \pi k t) \tag{2}$$` 

I want you to see how the phase information is encoded in the representation of equation 2. `$a_k$` and `$b_k$` are referred to as Fourier coefficients. Write an expression for the coefficients `$a_k$`, `$b_k$` and `$a_0$`.


## Solution Form
To check your answer, calculate the sum of `$a_0$`, `$a_1$` and `$b_1$` given the following information:

`$A_0=-1/2$`, `$A_1 = 0.7$`, `$\phi_1 = \pi/5$`.

(make sure your calculator is using radians)
