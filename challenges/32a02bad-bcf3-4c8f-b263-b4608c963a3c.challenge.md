## Comments
*Note that the notation `$y^{(2)}$` means "the 2nd differential of y" while the notation `$y^2$` (without the brackets around the `$2$`) means "y-squared".*

Considering the general form of an nth-order linear equation,
`$$
    a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y^{(1)} + a_0 y = g(t)
$$`
we substitute `$x_1=y$`, `$x_2=y'$`, `$\ldots$`, `$x_n=y^{(n-1)}$` and `$x_n'=y^{(n)}$`.

When replacing a `$y$`-term by an `$x$` term, the `$n$` in `$x_n$` corresponds to one more than the number of times `$y$` is differentiated. So `$x_{n+1}$` corresponds to `$y$` being differentiated `$n$` times and similarly `$x_n$` corresponds to `$y$` being differentiated `$n-1$` times.

Note that `$x_n'$` is one more differential than `$x_n$`, so `$x_n'$` corresponds to `$(y^{(n-1)})' = y^{(n)}$`.
So the `$n$` in `$x_n'$` corresponds to the number of times `$y$` is differentiated (ie, `$y^{(n)}$`).

To understand how this helps us write high-order ODE's as a system of equations, consider the equation
`$$
    y''' - 2y'' + 3y' - 4y = 0
$$`

First re-write the ODE in terms of `$x$` and `$x'$`. Note that there is no `$x_0'$` so we just write it as `$x_1$` in both equations.

`$$
    x_4 - 2 x_3 + 3 x_2 - 4 x_1 = 0 \\ 
    x_3' - 2 x_2' + 3 x_1' - 4 x_1 = 0 
$$`

Let's call these equations (1) and (2) respectively.

Our aim is to write the system of equations in the form `$\bm{x'} = \bm{A}\bm{x}$`. Note that there is no `$x_4'$` in our equations, so the largest value of `$n$` in `$x_n'$` will be 3 (ie, `$x_3'$`). So we can write
`$$
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1' \\
            x_2' \\
            x_3'
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
    \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            ? & ? & ? \\
            ? & ? & ? \\
            ? & ? & ?
        \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1 \\
            x_2 \\
            x_3
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`
where the question marks are values that we have to find.

By direct comparison of equations (1) and (2) we know that `$x_1' = x_2$` which can be written as `$x_1' = 0 x_1 + 1 x_2 + 0 x_3$` yielding the first line in the matrix `$\bm{A}$`:
`$$
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1' \\
            x_2' \\
            x_3'
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
    \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            0 & 1 & 0 \\
            ? & ? & ? \\
            ? & ? & ?
        \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1 \\
            x_2 \\
            x_3
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`

We can then proceed to do `$x_2$` in a similar fashion:
`$$
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1' \\
            x_2' \\
            x_3'
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
    \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 \\
            ? & ? & ?
        \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1 \\
            x_2 \\
            x_3
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`

In order to express `$x_3'$` in the above matrix form, we need it in terms of `$x_1$`, `$x_2$` and `$x_3$` rather than `$x_4$`, so instead of direct comparison, we swap `$x_4$` for `$x_3'$` in equation (1) to read
`$$
    x_3' - 2 x_3 + 3 x_2 - 4 x_1 = 0
$$`
and then isolate `$x_3'$` to read `$x_3' = 4 x_1 - 3 x_2 + 2 x_3$` yielding the final form of our systems of equations
`$$
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1' \\
            x_2' \\
            x_3'
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
    \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 \\
            4 & -3 & 2
        \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1 \\
            x_2 \\
            x_3
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`

Note that this is only considering a homogeneous equation. If it is non-homogeneous, you will have an extra term in the final step and will need a matrix of the form  `$\bm{x'} = \bm{A}\bm{x} + \bm{g}$` as shown in the answer to exercise 4(b) on page 5 of the PDF.

So why do we want to do this? Well, notice that in this example we started with a complicated 3rd-order ODE and reduced it into 3 1st-order ODE's. Similarly, if we started with a 2nd-order ODE, we could reduce the equation to 2 1st-order ODE's. In general, for an nth-order ODE we can reduce it to `$n$` 1st-order ODE's. If we can then learn how to solve simultanious sets of 1st-order ODE's, we have a powerful method of increasing our understanding (and even solving) difficult higher-order ODE's. 

For the other perspective, it can be noted that if you have a system of two 1st-order ODE's, you can know that it can form a single 2nd-order ODE too. 

## Challenge
Write the following ODE in matrix form:
`$$
