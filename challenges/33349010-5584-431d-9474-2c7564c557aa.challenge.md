## Challenge
A thin plastic membrane is used to maintain separation between helium and an outer chamber. Under steady-state conditions, the concentration of helium is `$0.02~\text{kmol}/\text{m}^3$` and `$0.005~\text{kmol}/\text{m}^3$` at the inner and outer boundaries respectively. If the membrane is `$1~\text{mm}$` thick and the binary diffusion coefficient of helium in the plastic membrane is `$10^{-9}~\text{m}^2/\text{s}$`, what is the diffusive flux through the membrane in terms of `$\text{kg}/\text{s}/\text{m}^2$`?
