## Comments
Here the system is stationary until `$t=5$` when, instead of applying a constant force, we "kick" the system to start the oscillation. Thus you should expect your answer to reflect physics such as this.

A hint for doing the inverse Laplace transform in this challenge: you will need to multiply the transform by a constant in order to obtain the inverse transform. Also, the graph below should give you a strong indication as to the form of the solution.

## Challenge
Solve

`$$
    y''+2y=\delta(t-5)
$$`

for `$y$`, given initial conditions `$y(0)=0$` and `$y'(0)=0$`.

## Solution Form
To check your answer, calculate `$y(7)$`.

Note how this gives rise to a simple oscillation after `$t=5$`, and nothing before it.
