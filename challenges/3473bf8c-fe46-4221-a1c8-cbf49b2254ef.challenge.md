## Comment

The "damping" term is often used to describe damping of oscillations of a system. Here is an example where it suppresses any oscillation and leads to a strong decay of the signal.

## Challenge

1. Solve the following 2nd-order differential equation that has real roots:

`$$ y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0 $$`

2. What is the effect of the damping term here?

## Resources

## Comments
Please check the answer to part (1) by calculating `$y(1)$` given initial conditions `$y(0) = 5$` and `$y'(0) = âˆ’8$`.

For part (2), please discuss with your partner in class.
