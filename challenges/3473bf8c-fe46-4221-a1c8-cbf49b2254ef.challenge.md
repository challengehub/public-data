## Challenge

1. Solve the following 2nd-order differential equation that has real roots:

y′′ + 3y′ + 2y = 0

2. What is the effect of the damping term here?

## Comments

For part (2), please discuss with your partner or the teacher in class.

Please check the answer to part (1) by calculating y(1) given initial conditions y(0) = 5 and y′(0) = −8.
