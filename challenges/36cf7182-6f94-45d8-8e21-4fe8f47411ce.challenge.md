## Comments
Considering the matrix
`$$
    A = \left(
        \begin{array}{cc}
            1 & 2 \\
            -3 & -4
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`
The eigenvalues are -2 and -1. Considering the eigenvalue -2, 
`$$
    A - Ir = \left(
        \begin{array}{cc}
            3 & 2 \\
            -3 & -2
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`
To determine the eigenvector we can either take the top or bottom row in the calculation `$(A - Ir)x = 0$`.
The top and bottom row appear with different numbers but it is easy to see that they yield multiples of the same eigenvector and are therefore equivalent.

Complex eigenvectors are no different, but it can sometimes be hard to see that they are indeed equivalent. This challenge lets you practise detection of this equivalency.

## Challenge
Show that the equation `$(A - Ir)\bm{x} = {0}$`, where
`$$
     A-Ir = \left(
        \begin{array}{cc}
            -3 -3i & 6 \\
            -3 & 3-3i
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`
yields the same eigenvector, irrespective of whether you calculate the eigenvector using the top or bottom row of `$(A-Ir)$`. You may find that one of the representations of the eigenvectors looks like `$(1-i,1)$`.

## Solution Form
You should be able to generate two eigenvectors by using the top and bottom rows of the `$A-Ir$` matrix, and show that they are in fact the same eigenvector by multiplying by an equivalent (imaginary) number. Please discuss with your partner or the teacher in class if you have trouble.

You may mark this challenge as complete by declaring the difficulty of the challenge.
