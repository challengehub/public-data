## Comment
The pages in the PDF go into more detail than the videos, considering a greater range of cases. You may note that here the particular solution is denoted by `$Y$` while Sal Khan denoted it as `$y_p$` in the videos.

## Challenge
Using the method of undetermined coefficients, calculate
`$$y'' + 4y = 8 \cos 2t$$`

## Solution
Assuming that the constants you find in your solution are all equal to 1, check your answer by calculating `$y(t=0.4)$` in each case. To check your answer, please subsume all constants on any term into the constant that you set to 1. For example, instead of `$y(t) = -2 C_1 e^{-t} + e^{-t}$`, write `$y(t) = C_1 e^{-t}$` where the two `$e^{-t}$` terms have been combined and the `$-2$` has been subsumed into the constant `$C_1$`, and then set `$C_1 = 1$` to check the answer.
