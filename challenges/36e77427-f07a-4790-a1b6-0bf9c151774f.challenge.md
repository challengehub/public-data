## Comment
The PDF in the resources goes into more detail than the videos on Khan academy, considering a greater range of cases. You may note that the particular solution is denoted by `$Y$` in the PDF while Sal Khan denotes it as `$y_p$` in his videos.

## Challenge
Using the method of undetermined coefficients, calculate the general solution to the ODE:
`$$y'' + 4y = 8 \cos 2t$$`

Tseng at Pennsylvania State University, USA (http://www.math.psu.edu/tseng/). Used in this course with kind permission.)*

## Solution
To check your answer, please collect all common terms together and then assume the constants for the homogeneous equations `$C_1$`, `$C_2$` etc are 1. Then check your answer by calculating `$y(t=0.4)$`.
