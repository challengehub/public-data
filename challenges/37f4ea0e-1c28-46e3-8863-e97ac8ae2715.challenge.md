## Comments
It is worth spending some time getting comfortable with manipulating matrices, since this is an indispensable basis for the work that is about to follow. The PDF gives a quick introduction to matrices. For a more thorough introduction, the Khan Academy playlist on [linear algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate-bases) is excellent, although beyond the scope of this course.

One note to deal with any confusion arising with regard to eigenvectors with matrices with zeros. For `$(A-rI)$` equal to something like

`$$
\left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
        0 & 0 \\
        1 & 2
    \end{array}
\right)
$$`

the top row can be ignored since any `$x_1$` and `$x_2$` will satisfy the top row.

Similarly, for a case such as
`$$
\left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
        2 & 0 \\
        2 & 0
    \end{array}
\right)
$$`

you will have

`$$
\begin{aligned}
    2 x_1 + 0 x_2 &= 0 \\
    2 x_1 &= 0 \\
    x_1 &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$`

which is satisfied by
`$$
\left(
    \begin{array}{c}
        0 \\
        1
    \end{array}
\right)$$`

(where the `$1$` could in principle be any number, but is the minimum integer that satisfies the condition.)

Finally, note that `$(A-rI) = ((a, b), (c, d))$` will give you two equivalent formulas `$a x_1 + b x_2 = 0$` and `$c x_1 + b x_2 = 0$`, even if they may appear different on first glance. If you want, you can prove to yourself that they are the same by multiplying the bottom row by `$a/c$`.


## Challenge
Considering the matrices
`$$
    \mathbf{C} =
\left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
        -5 & -1 \\
        7 & 3
    \end{array}
\right)
$$`

and

`$$
    \mathbf{D} =
\left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
        2 & 0 \\
        -2 & -1
    \end{array}
\right)
$$`

calculate `$\mathbf{(CD)}^{-1}$`
