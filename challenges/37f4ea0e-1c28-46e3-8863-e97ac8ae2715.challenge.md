## Comments
It is worth spending some time getting comfortable with manipulating matrices, since this is an indispensable basis for the work that is about to follow. The PDF gives a quick introduction to matrices. For a more thorough introduction, the Khan Academy playlist on [linear algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate-bases) is excellent, although beyond the scope of this course.


## Challenge
Considering the matrices
`$$
    \mathbf{C} =
\left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
        -5 & -1 \\
        7 & 3
    \end{array}
\right)
$$`

and

`$$
    \mathbf{D} =
\left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
        2 & 0 \\
        -2 & -1
    \end{array}
\right)
$$`

calculate `$\mathbf{(CD)}^{-1}$`
