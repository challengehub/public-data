title: Drawing the set and image of the ray arg(z) = - 3/4 pi

---

## Comments

The complex power functions and complex polynomial functions are in a sense the "simplest" nonlinear complex functions. We will use them to approximate more "complex" nonlinear complex functions and hence we need to have a basic idea how they work. First focus on good understanding of `$z^2$` and `$z^\frac12$`. Later similar principles apply in the case of `$z^n$` and `$z^\frac1n$`.

## Challenge

Find the image of the given set under the mapping `$w = z^2$`. Represent the mapping by drawing the set and its image:
    
The ray `${\rm arg}(z) = - \frac{3}4\pi$`
