## Comments
Derivation of the Runge-Kutta method is beyond this course, however there are many resources online going into more detail. This video-series is nice, although optional:

## Challenge
1. Considering the ODE:

`$$ \dot{v} = g - v^2 $$`


estimate `$v(1/2)$` using the Runge-Kutta method and a step-size of `$\Delta t = \frac{1}{4}$`.

2. Compare your answer to `$v(1/2)$` obtained using the Euler method with the same step-size. How does the behaviour differ?
