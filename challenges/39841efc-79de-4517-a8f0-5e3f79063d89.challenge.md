## Challenge

1. Define what is meant by the following terms:

- Body cone
- Space cone
- Instantanious axis of rotation

2. What is the relative velocity at the intersection between the body cone and space cone?

3. Draw a body and space cone for
    a) The case of constant angular velocity
    b) The case of changing angular velocity

*Correction to book: Figure 7/9 should read `$\bm{\alpha} = \bm{\dot{\omega}} = \bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{\omega}$` (not `$\bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{r}$`)*
