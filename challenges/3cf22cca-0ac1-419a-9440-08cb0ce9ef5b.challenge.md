title: Expand f(z)=(z-3)/((z-1)(z+1)) into a series that is valid for the domain |z|>1

---

## Challenge
Expand `$\displaystyle{f(z)=\frac{z-3}{(z-1)(z+1)}}$` in a series valid for the domain `$|z|>1$`.

## Resources
- Chapters 6.2 to 6.3 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
You will have a series with a sum from `$k=0$` to `$k=\infty$`.
Enter the value of the term for `$k=3$` for the case that `$z=2$`.
