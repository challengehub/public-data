## Comment

The resource gives a nice introduction to the Fourier coefficient `$a_k$`. You will notice that the derivation in the video derives the first term to be `$a_0$` instead of the `$\frac{a_0}{2}$` which we use in this course. This is simply a matter of choice of convention. Although the video does not go into so much detail, the general expression for `$a_0$` as used in the video is

`$$
a_0 = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T f(t) dt
$$`

where T is the period of the signal.
In our case, we simply re-define `$a_0$` to be

`$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) dt
$$`

and then to maintain equivalency of `$f(t)$` our first term becomes `$\frac{a_0}{2}$` instead of simply `$a_0$`.

## Challenge
Derive an expression for the Fourier coefficient `$a_k$` in
`$$ f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k \cos(2 \pi k t) + b_k \sin(2 \pi k t) $$`

Note the difference in period between the above equation and the suggested resource.
