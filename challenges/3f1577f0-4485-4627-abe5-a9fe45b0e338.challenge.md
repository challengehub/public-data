## Comment
This is a nice video showing the importance of considering resonance during building design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMr1MzSv044

## Challenge
Resonance occurs when the system is forced at its natural frequency (ie, `$\omega = \omega_0$`).

1. Show that when starting from position "0" at rest, when the system is driven at its natural frequency it evolves with time according to the equation
`$$
    x(t) = \frac{F}{2 m \omega_0} t \sin \omega t
$$`

2. Draw a graph depicting what is happening as time evolves, and briefly explain what resonance is.
