## Challenge
Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to the temperature difference with the ambient surroundings.

**(a)** Write a differential equation describing this situation.
**(b)** Assuming a proportionality constant of `$0.2/\text{hour}$`, what is the rate of temperature change when the object is at `$30^\text{o}\text{C}$` and the ambient temperature in the room is `$20^\text{o}\text{C}$`?
