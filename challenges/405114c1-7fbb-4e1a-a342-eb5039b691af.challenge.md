## Intro

In this challenge we introduce the concept of  an eigenvalue and an eigenvector for an `$n\times n$` matrix. As we will experience ourselves,  these simple notions carry the most important pieces of information about a matrix. The so called "eigenvalue problem", i.e., the problem of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, has many applications in all sort of fields.   



## Terminology

- eigenvalue
- eigenvector
- eigenspace


## Comments

Pay close attention to the definitions. The devil is in the detail!

## Challenge

1. Show that `$\bf v$` is an eigenvector of the matrix `$A$` and find the corresponding eigenvalue.

    a) `$A = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 3 \\ 3 & 0 \end{array} \right]$`, `$ {\bf v} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]$`
    
    b) `$A = \left[\begin{array}{ccr} 0 & 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1& 2 &0 \end{array} \right]$`, `$ {\bf v} = \left[\begin{array}{r} -2\\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]$`

2. Show that `$\lambda$` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `$A$` and find one eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

    a) `$A = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 4 \\ -1 & 5 \end{array} \right]$`, `$ \lambda =1$`
    
    b) `$A = \left[\begin{array}{ccr} 1 & 0 & 2 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\ 2& 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]$`, `$ \lambda = -1$` 
    
3. Use the method of Example 4.5 in the textbook to find all of the eigenvalues of the matrix `$A$`. Give bases for each of the corresponding eigenspaces. 

    a) `$A = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 4 \\ 6 & 0 \end{array} \right]$`
    
    b) `$A = \left[\begin{array}{rc} 1 & 2 \\ -2 & 3 \end{array} \right]$`

## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however it is a waste of time for everybody if you do not aim higher.
