title: Counting fish

---

## Challenge
Consider a fish situated at `$y=0$` at time `$t=1$`. The velocity of the fish `$dy/dt$` is given by the equation

`$$ \frac{dy}{dt} = \sin^2(yt) + e^{-y} - t$$`

Write a program to use computational numerical integration to determine the position of the fish at time `$t=100$` (ie, the value of `$y(100)$`).

## Solution Form
Enter the position `$y$` at the time specified.
