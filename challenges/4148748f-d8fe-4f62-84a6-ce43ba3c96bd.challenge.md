## Challenge
The position as a function of time of a mass at the end of a harmonic spring that is undergoing forced vibration can be given by
`$$
    x(t) = C_3 \cos(\omega_0 t - \phi) + \frac{F}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)} \cos \omega t
$$`

*Assuming that the mass on the spring starts at rest at position "0"*, solve for the constant `$C_3$` and the phase-shift `$\phi$`, and then use trigonometric identity

`$$
    \cos \alpha - \cos \beta = -2 \sin \left( \frac{\alpha - \beta}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{\alpha + \beta}{2} \right)
$$`

to show that the position of the mass can be given by

`$$
x(t) = \frac{2 F}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)} \sin \left( \frac{\omega_0 - \omega}{2} t \right) \sin \left( \frac{\omega_0 + \omega}{2} t \right)
$$`
