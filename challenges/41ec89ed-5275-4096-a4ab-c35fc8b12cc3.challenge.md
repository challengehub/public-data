## Comments
This challenge gives you the opportunity to understand the classic application of Fourier series to solving the heat distribution on a ring. It's somewhat involved but I recommend to take your time to make sure you understand the steps involved.


## Challenge
Starting from the heat (diffusion) equation `$u_t = u_{xx}/2$`, show that the general solution to the heat equation on a ring is given by

`$$ u(x,t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{n=\infty} c_n(0) e^{-2 \pi^2 n^2 t} e^{i 2 \pi n x} $$`

and write an expression for `$c_n(0)$` in terms of the initial temperature distribution `$u(x,0)$`.
