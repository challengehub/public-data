## Comment
The angular velocity of the link `$\bar{AB}$` is, by definition, perpendicular to the axis of the link. In the second part of this challenge, you use this fact along with other obtained equations to obtain the 3 Cartesian directions of the angular velocity vector. Note that although the concept of the angular momentum of the link `$\bar{AB}$` is used to calculate `$w_2$` in the first part of the problem, you don't actually need to calculate the value of the `$\bm{w_n}$` vector in order to determine the value of `$w_2$`.
