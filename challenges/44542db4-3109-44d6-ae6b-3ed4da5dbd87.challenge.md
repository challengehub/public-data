## Comments
Here we expand our study to convolution; a powerful function for processing signals. This introduction by Prof. Osgood provides an excellent introduction. What you will learn here is that convolution in real space is related to multiplication in frequency space. Visualisation of what convolution in real-space means however, is rather difficult, and I would recommend to focus purely on the mathematical meaning here of how it relates functions in real space and frequency space.


## Challenge
Briefly describe what convolution of two functions means, and how it can relate two functions of time in real space to their equivalent functions in frequency space.

Show that convolution in real-space (`$\mathscr{F}(g*f)(s)$`) corresponds to multiplication in frequency space (`$\mathscr{F}g(s) \mathscr{F}f(s)$`).
