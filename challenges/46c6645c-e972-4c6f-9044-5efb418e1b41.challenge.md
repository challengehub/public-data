## Challenge
Considering the chain sample problem and the unconstrained rope problem, why was the kinetic energy different in these two cases? What assumptions were made in the chain problem compared to the unconstrained rope problem, and how did this impact the calculation of kinetic energy?

Please write a few sentences summarising your understanding.
