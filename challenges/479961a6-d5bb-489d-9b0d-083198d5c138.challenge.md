## Challenge
Evaporation pans like the one shown here are used to measure the rate of evaporation of water in a local area.

![Evaporation pan](/api/v0/teachers/github.NanoScaleDesign/resources/public/3aa238f5-d586-4b63-b76e-a4931e346ecc.jpeg/3aa238f5-d586-4b63-b76e-a4931e346ecc.jpeg)

An evaporation pan is placed in a location with an ambient air temperature of 298 K and relative humidity of 25%. The pan contains water at the same temperature as the surrounding air. The pan has a diameter of 20 cm and height of 160 mm, and it starts half-full of water.

Assuming only diffusive mass transport, what is the initial evaporation rate?

(The saturation pressure of water at 298 K is 0.03531 bar, and its specific volume at an atmospheric pressure of  1 atm is 39.13 `$m^3/kg$`.)
