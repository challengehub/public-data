## Challenge

Considering the formula for the principle n'th root function:

`$$z^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{|z|}e^{i {\rm arg}(z)/n}$$`

Use formula (14) from the textbook to find the value of the given principal `$n$`th root function at the given value of `$z$`. 
    
a) `$z^\frac12$`, `$z= 2+i$`

b) `$z^\frac13$`, `$z= -1$` 

c) `$z^\frac15$`, `$z= -1 + \sqrt3i$`
