title: Showing z_2 = k z_1*

## Comments
Our first step is to make sure that there is no confusion when calculating with complex numbers.


## Challenge
Suppose the product `$z_1z_2$` of two complex numers is a nonzero real constant. Show that `$z_2 = k \overline z_1$`, where `$k$` is a real number.
