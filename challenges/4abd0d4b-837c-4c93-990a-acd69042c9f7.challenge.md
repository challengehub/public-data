## Comments
Considering a pendulum gently swinging backwards and forwards, it is possible to trace out the phase-space as shown here:

If you increase the speed of the pendulum, at some critical point, instead of swinging back to the original position it will start whirring round and round. Expressed in terms of vertical angle and angular velocity, the graph becomes:

At low velocities the pendulum swings back and forth (blue circles, angular velocity both positive and negative), but at high velocities, the angular velocity stays positive (or negative) and the pendulum whirs round and round in one direction (blue wavy lines). Note that position `$\theta = \pi$` is when the rigid pendulum is pointing exactly upwards. So with no momentum it is stationary here, albeit unstable, because with a tiny velocity it will perform a full loop, slowing (but not stopping) as it reaches the top again.


## Challenge
Considering the graph shown earlier of angular momentum vs angle for a rigid pendulum, add the points of the following true statements:

**1 point** An initial angular velocity of 1 unit results in whirring circular motion irrespective of the starting angle.

**2 points** An initial angular velocity of -2.5 units results in whirring circular motion irrespective of the starting angle.

**4 points** An initial angle of `$\pi/2$` combined with an angular velocity of 1 unit results in periodic swinging motion.

**8 points** An initial angle of `$\pi/2$` combined with an angular velocity of 1 unit results in circular whirring motion.

**16 points** An initial angle of `$0$` combined with an angular velocity of 0 units results in periodic swinging motion.

**32 points** An initial angle of `$0$` combined with an angular velocity of 0 units results in a stationary system.

**64 points** An initial angle of `$\pi$` combined with an angular velocity of 0 units results in a stationary system.

**128 points** An initial angle of `$\pi/2$` combined with an angular velocity of 0 units results in a stationary system.

**256 points** An initial angular velocity of 3 units results in whirring circular motion in the same direction as an initial angular velocity of -3 units.

**512 points** An initial angular velocity of 3 units results in whirring circular motion in the opposite direction as an initial angular velocity of -3 units.
