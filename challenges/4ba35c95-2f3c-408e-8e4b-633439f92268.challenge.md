## Comments
Here you will learn qualitatively about the Gibb's phenomenon. The full derivation is beyond the scope of this course, but it is important that you understand its existance and a basic example.

The aim of this challenge is to enable you to be able to describe qualitatively what Gibb's phenomenon is using a few sentences (part (a)), and know the amount of overshoot in the case of a standard `$\pm 1$` square-wave (part (b)).


## Challenge
**a)** Qualitatively speaking, what is the Gibb's phenomenon?

**b)** Considering a square wave of the form
`$$
    f(t)=
    \begin{cases}
        -1 & \text{for } -\frac{1}{2} < t < 0 \\
        1 & \text{for } 0 < t < \frac{1}{2}
    \end{cases}
$$`
as the sum of the Fourier series goes to infinity, what is the maximum value of the signal?
*Note: In line with the aims of this challenge, you may simply enter the number without understanding the derivation in the notes.*
