## Comment

Here we include the same negative damping term, but due to the coefficient of the other terms you obtain roots of mixed signs.

## Challenge

Solve the following 2nd-order differential equation that has real roots.

2y′′ − 3y′ + 2y = 0

## Resources

- Book (http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/getfile.aspx?file=B,1,N) from page 108.
- Text: http://www.its.caltech.edu/~roberto/FSRI/Lecture/fsri_math_2011_Aug_4.pdf

## Solution

To check your solution, calculate y(1) given initial conditions y(0) = 5 and y′(0) = −20.
