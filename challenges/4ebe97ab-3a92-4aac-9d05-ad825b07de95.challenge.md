## Comment
The “damping” term is often used to describe damping of oscillations of a system; but it doesn’t need to have that effect. Depending on it’s value relative to the other terms, it can cause a mix of positive and negative feedback without any oscillations observed.

## Challenge

Solve the following 2nd-order differential equation that has real roots.

`$$ -2y'' − 3y' + 2y = 0 $$`

## Resources

- Book (http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/GetFile.aspx?file=B,1,N) from page 118.

## Solution

To check your solution, calculate `y(1)` given initial conditions `y(0) = 5` and `y′(0) = −20`.
