## Comments
Note that the video resource uses `$n$` to denote the `$n$`'th sample of the period and `$k$` to represent the `$k$`'th DFT coefficient.


## Challenge
Consider even DFT coefficients `$G[k]$` for a signal sampled `$N=24$` times. Consider the relation

`$$G[18] = G[p]$$`

where `$p<18$`. What is `$p$`?
