title: Obtaining an expression for the k'th real root of 1

---

## Comments

Unlike real roots the complex roots make a complete picture when dealing with power/polynomial equations. The next exercises give more in depth understanding of complex roots. Defend your answers with sound mathematics.

## Challenge

Suppose `$n$` denotes a non-negative integer. Obtain a general expression for the `$k$`th *real* root of `$1$` as a function of `$n$`. <!-- Note that your expression should only  yield the completely real roots and not complex roots. -->
