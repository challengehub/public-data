title: Finding the real and imaginary parts of complex polar functions

---

## Comment

One of the most important concepts in modern mathematics is that of a function.
Let make sure that we know the basic terminology and know the complex exponential function.

## Challenge
Find the real and imaginary parts of `$f(z)$` as functions of `$r$` and `$\theta$`.

a) `$f(z) = z^5$`
    
b) `$f(z) = \bar{z}$`
    
c) `$f(z) = |z|$`

## Resources
    
- Chapter 1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
After completing (a-c), sum the real parts for all 3 answers assuming `$r=2$` and `$\theta=\frac\pi4$` to check your answer.
Please compare your solution with your partner in class.
