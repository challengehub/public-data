## Comment

One of the most important concepts in modern mathematics is that of a function.
Let make sure that we know the basic terminology and know the complex exponential function.

## Challenge
2. Find the real and imaginary parts of `$f(z)$` as functions of `$r$` and `$\theta$`.

a) `$f(z) = z^5$`
    
b) `$f(z) = \bar{z}$`
    
c) `$f(z) = |z|$`

## Resources
    
- Chapter 2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
After completing (a-c), enter the value of `$r$` in (c) assuming `$z=3+4i$`.
