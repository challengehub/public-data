## Comments

To understand complex numbers better we simply need to use them more and ask more questions.
For every answer give an easily understandable argument. Saying that something is obvious or easy is not a valid argument!

## Challenge

1.  What can be said about the complex number `$z$` if `$z = \overline z$`? If `$(z)^2 = (\overline z)^2$` ?
2. Suppose `$z_1$` and `$z_2$`  are complex numbers. What can be said about `$z_1$` or `$z_2$` if `$z_1z_2 = 0$`?
3.  Suppose the product `$z_1z_2$` of two complex numers is a nonzero real constant. Show that `$z_2 = k \overline z_1$`, where `$k$` is a real number.
4. Without doint any significant work, explain why it follows immediately from equations (2) and (3) in the textbook that `$z_1 \overline z_2 + \overline z_1 z_2 = 2 {\rm Re}(z_1 \overline z_2)$`.

5. Prove the following statement.  "Zero and unity are unique in the complex number system." After that you may call them the zero and the unity. 

## Resources

- Check the textbook.
 
- Go back to previous challenges.

- Explore  the Internet.

## Tips

- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
