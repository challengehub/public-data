## Comment
To solve this challenge, you will need to keep in mind the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem for Multiply Connnected Domains. It is discussed in the book in chapter 5.3.

## Challenge
Calculate the integral
`$$\oint_C \frac{3z+i}{z^2+1} \ dz$$`
where `$C : |z|=2$`

## Resources
- Chapters 5.5.1 and 5.3 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
You will have a final answer that can be written in the form `$x+iy$`.
To check your answer, enter `$x+y$`.
