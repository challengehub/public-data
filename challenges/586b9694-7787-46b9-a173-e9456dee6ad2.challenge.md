## Challenge
Consider a cube. The *x*, *y* and *z* axes pass through the centre of the cube perpendicular to the faces of the cube (ie, each axis passes through the centre of a face). The mass of the cube is evenly distributed so the centre-of-mass of the cube is in the centre, where the 3 axes cross.

The off-diagonal values of inertia `$I_{xy}$`, `$I_{xz}$` and `$I_{yz}$` are zero. Show this mathematically.
