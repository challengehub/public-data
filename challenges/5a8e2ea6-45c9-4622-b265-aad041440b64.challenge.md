## Challenge
Starting from basic knowledge of absolute flux in terms of both diffusion and advection:
`$$
    N''_A = -C D_{AB} \Delta x_A + x_A N''_A
$$`
show that evaporation in a stationary column (figure 14.2 in the book) can be given by
`$$
    N''_A = \frac{C D_{AB}}{L} ln \left( \frac{1-x_{A,L}}{1-x_{A,0}} \right)
$$`
where `$x_{A,L}$` and `$x_{A,0}$` are the molar fractions at the top and bottom the column, respectively.
