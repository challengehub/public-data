title: Find the Maclaurin series and radius of conversion of e^z

---

## Challenge
Find the Maclaurin series and use it to obtain the radius of convergence for the function:

`$$f(z)=e^z$$`

## Resources
- Chapter 6.2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
Enter the radius of convergence.
If the radius is infinite, type "infinite" as your answer.
