## Challenge
An 18K gold chain has a mass of 1.12 g and a length of 40 cm. You pick up one end of the chain and lift it up vertically at a constant velocity of 5 cm/s. There will be two downward forces present: one due to the hanging weight of the chain due to earth's gravity (*A*), and another induced by the constant addition of mass to the hanging part of the chain (*B*).

- Calculate *B*
- State what simplifying assumptions you make
- How does this compare to *A*?


## Resources
- Section 4/7 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution Form
To check your answer, enter your calculated value for *B* in units of **Î¼N**. Please compare your answers to the other parts of this challenge with your partner in class.
