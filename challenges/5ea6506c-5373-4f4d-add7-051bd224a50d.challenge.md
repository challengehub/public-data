title: Counting carrots

---

## Comments

Carrots are helpful for a healthy diet, so it's important to be able to count them. Keep in mind that `$ c(t) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} C(t) e^{2 \pi i t} dt $`.

A **bunch** of carrots: ![carrots_vsmall](/api/v0/teachers/github.NanoScaleDesign/resources/public/5aa8e7ea-b75d-4a14-bb9a-ce26bf6c4e3e.jpeg)
