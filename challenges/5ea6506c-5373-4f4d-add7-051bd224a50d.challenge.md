title: Counting carrots

---

## Comments

Since carrots are helpful for a healthy diet, it's important that you learn to count them.

## Challenge


If you start with 10 carrots and eat 1 every day, after how many days will you run out of carrots?

Note: `$ c(t) = \int_{0}^{\infty} C(t) e^{2 \pi i t} dt $`

This is what a **bunch** of carrots of looks like:
