## Terminology 

- complex plane
- real and imaginary axes
- modulus (absolute value) of a complex number and its properties
- distance between two points
- triangle inequality




## Comments

To visualize complex numbers we associate them with points or vectors in `$\mathbb R^2$`, that is, we create a complex plane. 


## Challenge

1. Evaluate `$|1-i|$`.

2. Express `$|z+ 5\overline z|$`  in terms of `$x$` and `$y$` for `$z = x + iy$`.

3. Describe the set of points `$z$` in the complex plane that satisfy the given equation.

   a) `$|z-i| = | z-1|$` 

   b) `$\overline z = z^{-1}$`

   c) `$|z| = {\rm Re}(z)$`
4. Prove `$|z_1 z_2| = |z_1||z_2|$`.

5. Show that `$|z| = |-z| = |\overline z|$`.
 
6. Under what circumstances does `$|z_1 + z_2| = |z_1 | + |z_2|$`?

## Tips

- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
