## Comments

Theorem 2.1 on page 116 of the book in the resources states:

`$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text { Suppose that } f(z)=u(x, y)+i v(x, y), z_{0}=x_{0}+i y_{0}, \text { and } L=u_{0}+i v_{0}\\
&\text { Then } \lim _{z \rightarrow z_{0}} f(z)=L \text { if and only if }\\
&\lim _{(x, y) \rightarrow\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)} u(x, y)=u_{0} \quad \text { and } \quad \lim _{(x, y) \rightarrow\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)} v(x, y)=v_{0}
\end{aligned}
$$`

Note that the video in the resources below gives a clearer rationale for taking the limits of the below functions than the book does. At this stage, we are learning *how* to take limits more than figuring out what the limits are (since in some of these simple cases it is quite obvious), and I strongly recommend that you view the video.

## Challenge
Use theorem 2.1 and the properties of real limits on page 115 to compute the given complex limit.

a)  `$\displaystyle{\lim_{z \to 3i}}\   (z^2 + 1)$`
   
b)  `$\displaystyle{\lim_{z \to 1+i}} \  \  \frac{z - \overline z}{z + \overline z} $`
   
c) `$\displaystyle{\lim_{z \to \pi i }} \ \  e^z$`

## Solution Form
Sum your answers for (a)-(c) into a sum of the form `$\alpha+i \beta$`, then for a simple check of your answer, calculate and enter `$$\alpha+10\beta$$`
and compare your solution with your partner in class.
