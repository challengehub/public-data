title: Calculating the mass of a wire with density proportional to distance from the
  y-axis, using a line integral

---

## Challenge

If `$\rho(x,y)$` kg/m is the density of a wire, then the mass of the wire is `$m = \int_C \rho(x,y) ds$`. Find the mass of a wire having the distances from the `$x$` and `$y$` axes that form a semicircle in the form `$x = 1+ \cos t$` metres, `$ y = \sin t$` metres, `$ 0 \leq t \leq \pi$`, if the density at a point `$P$` is directly proportional to the distance from the `$y$`-axis.

## Solution Form
Assuming your proportionality constant is 2 kg/`$\text{m}^2$`, please enter your answer in kg to check it.
