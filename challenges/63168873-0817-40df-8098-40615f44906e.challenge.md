## Comments
Another important concept is phase. For a simple sine signal `$\theta(t) = sin(2 \pi t)$`, at `$t=0$` the angle `$\theta$` is zero, but one can shift the phase (starting point) of the signal by effectively making the sine-curve non-zero at `$t=0$`. Another way to think about it is to say the sine curve doesn't reach zero until a time `$t-\phi$` where `$\phi$` is the phase-shift added.

To achieve the learning aims of this challenge, try to do it without the assistance of digital equipment, just like in an exam.


## Challenge
Place the following four graphs in the image in the following order:

1. `$\sin(2 \pi t + \pi/2)$`
2. `$\sin(2 \pi t - \pi/2)$`
3. `$\sin(2 \pi t + \pi/4)$`
4. `$\sin(2 \pi t + 2 \pi)$`
