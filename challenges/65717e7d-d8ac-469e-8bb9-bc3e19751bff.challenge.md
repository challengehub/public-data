## Challenge
**a)** Consider a chain hanging over the edge of a block of height `$h$`. The chain has a total length `$L$` and mass per unit length of `$\rho$`. At time `$t=0$`, the right end of the chain lays on top of the block at its right side at position `$x=0$`, while the left end of the chain is barely touching the ground.

Initially the chain is stationary, but then the chain is released, causing the right side to accelerate horizontally in the left direction and the chain to pile up to the left of the block. Ignoring friction at the corner and making other idealised assumptions, obtain an expression for the acceleration of the chain as a function of the position of the end of the chain (`$x$`) as it slides along the horizontal surface, before it reaches the end of the block.

**b)** Did you need to consider the force generated by the stopping of the chain as it landed on the ground? If so, how did it come into the equation? If not, why not?

## Resources
- Section 4/7 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution Form
**a)** To check your answer, determine the acceleration for a height of 5 m and chain length of 10 m, at the moment when when the chain has slid 2 m, and enter your solution in units of m/s.

**b)** Please discuss your answer in class.
