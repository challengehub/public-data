(PDF challenge 4.17)

## Comment

This challenge gives you useful practise of going the other way; determining a differential equation that describes a given solution.

## Challenge

Determine the 2nd-order linear differential equation which has the general solution
`$$
    y = C_1 \cos 4t + C_2 \sin 4t - e^t \sin 2t
$$`

## Solution

You will end up with differential terms on the left side and a function of `$t$` on the right side.
Please compare your answer with your partner in class.
To check your answer with challenge-hub, evaluate the right side of your equation by substituting the value `$t=0.4$`.
