## Challenge
Assuming air is made up exclusively of oxygen (`$O_2$`) and nitrogen (`$N_2$`) with their partial pressures in the ratio `$0.21:0.79$`, what are their mass-fractions?

## Resources

- Sections 14.1.1 to 14.1.2 of *Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer* by F. Incropera et. al., 7th edition
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FLv0uxLrDI

## Solution Form
To check your solution, enter the mass fraction of oxygen.
