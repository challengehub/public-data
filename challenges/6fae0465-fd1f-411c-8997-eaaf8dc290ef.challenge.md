title: Identify the radius of convergence of the series ((z-1-3i)^n)/(n+3i)

---

## Challenge
Find the radius of convergence of the series:`$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(z-1-3i)^n}{n+3i}$$`

## Resources
- Chapters 6.1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
Enter the radius of convergence.
If the radius is infinite, type "infinite" as your answer.
