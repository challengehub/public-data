## Terminology 
- function
- real-valued function of a real variable
- complex function of a complex variable (complex function)
- image
- value
- domain
- range
- real and imaginary parts of a complex function
- complex exponential function
- exponential form of a complex number


## Comments

One of the most important concepts in modern mathematics is that of a function.
Let make sure that we know the basic terminology and know the complex exponential function.


## Challenge



1. Find the real and imaginary parts of `$f(z)$` as functions of `$x$` and `$y$`.
    
    a) `$f(z) = 3z - 2\bar{z} + i$`

    b) `$f(z) = z + 1 / z$`
    
    c) `$f(z) = \operatorname{exp}(z^2)$`

2. Find the real and imaginary parts of `$f(z)$` as functions of `$r$` and `$\theta$`.

    a) `$f(z) = z^5$`
    
    b) `$f(z) = \bar{z}$`
    
    c) `$f(z) = |z|$`


3. Prove the following statements.
 
    a) `$\operatorname{exp}(z+2\pi i) = \operatorname{exp}z$`

    b) `$\overline{\operatorname{exp} z} = \operatorname{exp}(\overline{z})$`
    
    c) `$|\operatorname{exp}z| = \operatorname{exp}(\mathrm{Re}(z))$`

- Check the textbook.

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/imaginary-and-complex-numbers)

- Explore the Internet.


## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
