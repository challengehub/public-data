## Comments

Unlike real roots the complex roots make a complete picture when dealing with power/polynomial equations. The next exercises give more in depth understanding of complex roots. Defend your answers with sound mathematics.

## Challenge

Suppose `$z$` is a complex number that possesses a fourth root `$w$` that is neither real nor pure imaginary. With the aid of the real-complex plane, explain why the remaining fourth roots are neither real nor pure imaginary.
