title: Finding the harmonic conjugate of u(x,y) = x

---

## Comment
I recommend working through the example given in the chapter in the book.

## Challenge
Verify that `$u(x,y)$` is harmonic and find its harmonic conjugate `$v(x,y)$`. Then use the supplied solution for `$f(z)$` to determine the value of the integration constant of `$v(x,y)$`. 

`$$u(x,y) = x$$` given `$f(1+i)=1$`.

## Solution Form
To check your answer, substitute `$x=2$` and `$y=3$` into your final expression for `$v$` and enter the value of `$v$`.
