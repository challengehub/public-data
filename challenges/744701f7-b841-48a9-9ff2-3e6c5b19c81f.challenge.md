## Comments
Our first step is to make sure that there is no confusion when calculating with complex numbers.


## Challenge
Calculate `$i^{8}+i^{35}+i^{137}$`


## Resources
- Chapter 1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
Enter your answer.
If your answer is complex, in the form `$\alpha + i \beta$`, enter the number `$\alpha + \beta$`. Be sure to check your solution with your partner in class.
