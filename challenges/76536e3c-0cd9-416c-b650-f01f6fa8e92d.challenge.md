## Challenge
Consider species *A* that is consumed at the surface shown in figure 14.7 in the book through a chemical reaction. The height of the system is `$20~\text{cm}$` and the mole-fraction at this height `$x=L$` is `$0.5$`. The total concentration of the mixture can be considered to be uniform at `$4~\text{kmol}/\text{m}^3$`. The diffusion coefficient of *A* in the mixture is `$10^{-3}~\text{m}^2/\text{s}$`.

What is the concentration of *A* at `$x=0$` under a **diffusion-limited** condition?


## Resources

- Section **14.5.3** of *Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer* by F. Incropera et. al., 7th edition


## Solution Form
Please enter your solution in `$\text{kmol}/\text{m}^3$`
