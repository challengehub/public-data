## Comments

See figure: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/imgmec/hook.gif

Second-order differential equations deal with oscillations. Here we consider harmonic oscillation of a spring. The aim of this challenge is to give you the opportunity to think about how the terms of a 2nd-order ODE relate to force and stiffness in the context of a spring.
The equations below describe fundamental mechanics of oscillatory motion as exemplified by the spring here. Hooke’s law states that the force leading to acceleration of the mass m is proportional to the stretching distance x. The proportionality constant is Hooke’s constant, k.

This can be written as (eqn 1):

`$$ mx'' + kx = 0$$`

or alternatively (eqn 2):

`$$mx'' = −kx$$` 

This leads to perfectly oscillating motion (eqn 3):

`$$ x(t) = cos(ωt) $$`

which oscillates forever since there is no damping term.

# Challenge

By considering the oscillatory motion (equation 3) as a solution of the 2nd-order differential equation given by Hooke’s law (equations 1 and 2), determine the oscillation frequency ω in terms of the mass and spring constant.

# Solution

To check your answer, calculate the oscillation frequency for a harmonic spring with a mass of 2 kg and spring-constant of 4 kg/s^2. Only enter numbers, without any units, in your answer.
