## Comments

See figure: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/imgmec/hook.gif

Second-order differential equations deal with oscillations. Here we consider harmonic oscillation of a spring. The aim of this challenge is to give you the opportunity to think about how the terms of a 2nd-order ODE relate to force and stiffness in such a context.

The equations below describe fundamental mechanics of oscillatory motion as exemplified by the spring here. Hooke’s law states that the force leading to acceleration of the mass `$m$` is proportional to the stretching distance `$x$`. The proportionality constant is Hooke’s constant, `$k$`.

This can be written as:

`$$ mx'' + kx = 0 \tag{1}$$`

or alternatively:

`$$mx'' = −kx \tag{2}$$` 

This leads to perfectly oscillating motion:

`$$ x(t) = cos(ωt) \tag{3}$$`

which oscillates forever since there is no damping term.

# Challenge

By considering the oscillatory motion (eqn 3) as a solution of the 2nd-order differential equation given by Hooke’s law (eqns 1 & 2), determine the oscillation frequency ω in terms of the mass and spring constant.

# Solution

To check your answer, calculate the oscillation frequency for a harmonic spring with a mass of `$2~\text{kg}$` and spring-constant of `$4~\text{kg}/\text{s}^2$`. Only enter numbers, without any units, in your answer.
