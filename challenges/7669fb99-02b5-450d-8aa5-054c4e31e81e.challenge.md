## Comments
The aim is to have you understand how the Fourier series coefficients arise. By now you should understand how to calculate `$a_k$`. If you have time, for extra practise I recommend that you try to calculate `$b_k$`. If you do not have time, please progress to the next challenge.


## Challenge
Derive an expression for the Fourier coefficient `$b_k$` in

`$$f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k \cos(2 \pi k t) + b_k \sin(2 \pi k t)$$`

Note the difference in period between the above equation and the suggested resource.
