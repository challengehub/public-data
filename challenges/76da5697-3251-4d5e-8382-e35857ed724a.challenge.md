**(Optional challenge)**
*It is recommend that you complete this challenge since this provides useful practise of what you have learned, but if you are short on time you may proceed to the next challenge.*

## Comment
For this challenge, note that if you encounter a square-root during your calculations such as `$\sqrt{7}$`, it is best to work with `$\sqrt{7}$` rather than `$2.65$` in order to maintain accuracy until the final step where you need to evaluate it. If the equation becomes too messy (eg `$e^{(\sqrt{7}-1)/\sqrt{3}}$`) you can always substitute `$m=(\sqrt{7}-1)/\sqrt{3}$`, etc, to make things clearer.

## Challenge

Determine `$y(0.2)$` for the equation

`$$ 2y'' + 4y' + 2y = 0 $$`

given the initial conditions `$y(0)=4$` and `$y'(0)=2$`.
