title: Calculate arccosh(1/2)

---

## Comment
Note that there is a general formula for calculating inverse trigonometric functions (given in the book) and you do not need to derive from first principles for this challenge, unless you would like to.

## Challenge
Obtain the general solution (including all `$2\pi k$` periods) of the following function: `$$\cosh^{-1}\left(\frac12\right)$$`

## Resources
- Chapter 4.4 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan, 1st edition


## Solution Form
You will obtain a solution in the form `$x+iy$`.
Setting `$k=1$`, enter `$x+y$`.
