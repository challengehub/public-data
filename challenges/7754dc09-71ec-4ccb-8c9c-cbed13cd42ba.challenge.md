## Terminology 
- complex linear function
- special types of complex linear function (translation `$T$`, rotation `$R$`, magnification `$M$`)
- angle of rotation of `$R$`
- magnification factor of `$M$`
- contraction
- composition of functions
- constant map
- identity mapping


## Comments

Linear functions are the easiest type of functions to visualize in complex plane. On the other hand,
they play a crucial role in the concept of limit and differentiation. We will be working with
them a lot and hence a good understanding of them is a must. 


## Challenge



1. Find the image of the closed disk `$|z| \leq 1$` under the given linear mapping `$w = f(z)$`.
    
    a) `$f(z) = z + 3i$`

    b) `$f(z) = 3iz$`
    
    c) `$f(z) = 2z-i$`

2. Express the given linear mapping `$w = f(z)$` as a composition of a rotation, magnification, and a translation as in formula (6) in the textbook. Then describe the action of the linear mapping in words out loud to yourself (no need to write down the description in words).

    a) `$f(z) = 3iz+4$`
    
    b) `$f(z) = -\frac12z + 1 - \sqrt{3} i$`
    



3. Find a linear mapping that maps the set `$S$` onto the set `$S'$`. Here, `$S$` is the square with vertices `$1+i, -1+i, -1-i, 1-i$` and `$S'$` is the square with vertices `$1, 2+i, 1+2i, i$`.
 

4. Express the  composition of magnification by `$2$`, translation by `$\sqrt2$` and roattion through `$\frac \pi4$` as a linear mapping `$f(z) = az + b$`.  

5. a) Prove that the composition of two translations `$T_1(z) = z + b_1$`, `$b_1 = \not  0$` and `$T_2 (z) = z + b_2$`, `$b_2 = \not  0$` is a translation. Does the order of composition matter?

 b) Prove that the composition of two rotations `$R_1(z) = a_1z $`, `$|a_1| = 1$` and `$R_2 (z) = a_2z$`, `$|a_2| = 1$` is a rotation. Does the order of composition matter? 

 c) Prove that the composition of two magnifications  `$M_1(z) = a_1z $`, `$a_1 > 0$` and `$M_2 (z) = a_2z$`, `$a_2> 0$` is a magnification. Does the order of composition matter? 

6. We say that two mappings `$f$` and `$g$` **commute** if `$ f\circ g(z) = g \circ f(z)$` for all `$z$`. That is , two mappings commute if the order in which you compose them does not change the mapping.

    a) Can a translation and a nonidentity rotation commute?

    b) Can a translation and a nonidentity magnification commute?
    
    c) Can a nonidentity rotation and a nonidentity magnification commute?


7. What can you say about a linear mapping `$f$` if you know that `$|z| = |f(z)|$` for all complex numbers `$z$`?
