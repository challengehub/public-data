## Challenge
The graphs below correspond to Fourier series calculation of a Fourier sine series and Fourier cosine series. Such series only contain sine and cosine terms, respectively.

**a)** State which graph corresponds to which series
**b)** Write a square-wave function that you think would involve both sine and cosine terms

**Graph A:**

![Fourier series I](/api/v0/teachers/github.NanoScaleDesign/resources/public/3bb5ee18-be89-4eac-8454-48a13ab5ec77.jpeg/3bb5ee18-be89-4eac-8454-48a13ab5ec77.jpeg)

**Graph B:**
