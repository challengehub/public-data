## Comments
I recommend to view the suggested resource as this gives a nice introduction to the subject and challenges ahead. Note that the period used in the video is different to that we're using in our description, but you should become comfortable with moving between different notations.


## Challenge
Write a few sentences describing in qualitative terms what the significance of the magnitude of the fourier coefficients `$a_k$` and `$b_k$` in a fourier series such as

`$$f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k \cos(2 \pi k t) + b_k \sin(2 \pi k t)$$`
