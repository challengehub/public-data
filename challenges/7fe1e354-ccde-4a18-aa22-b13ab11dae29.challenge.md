## Challenge
Imagine here you have two window functions `$f(t)$` and `$g(t)$`.

`$$
    f(t)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{for } |t| < 1/2 \\
        0 & \text{for } |t| > 1/2
    \end{cases}
$$`
and
`$$
    g(t)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{for } |t| < 1/2 \\
        0 & \text{for } |t| > 1/2
    \end{cases}
$$`

1. Use your knowledge of the Fourier transform of such window functions to calculate the frequency-domain spectrum of the convolution of these two window functions.

2. What is the resulting function in the time-domain? *This should be possible by deduction without substantial calculation.*


## Solution Form
To mark this challenge as attempted substitute `$s=0.25$` into your answer for part (1) and `$t=0.8$` for part (2), then add them together.
