## Comment

One of the most important concepts in modern mathematics is that of a function.
Let make sure that we know the basic terminology and know the complex exponential function.

## Challenge
Find the real and imaginary parts of `$f(z)$` as functions of `$x$` and `$y$`.
    
a) `$f(z) = 3z - 2\bar{z} + i$`

b) `$f(z) = z + 1 / z$`
    
c) `$f(z) = e^{z^2}$`

## Resources
    
- Chapter 2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
After completing (a-c), enter the value of the real part of (c) if x=2 and y=3
