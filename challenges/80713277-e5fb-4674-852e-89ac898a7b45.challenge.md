## Challenge
Considering the ordinary differential equation

`$$ y'' - 4 y = \sin t$$`

with the initial conditions `$y(0) = 0$` and `$y'(0) = 0$`, using the Laplace transform method and convolution, obtain the function `$y(t)$` in the form `$y(t) = C (A(t) * B(t))$` where `$C$` is a constant and `$A$` and `$B$` are functions of `$t$`. Do not attempt to perform the convolution.

## Solution Form
If `$A(0.7)=0.644$`, calculate `$B(0.7)$` to check your answer.
