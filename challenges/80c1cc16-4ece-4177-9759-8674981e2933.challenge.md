## Challenge

1. Assuming there is no damping term (ie, `$B=0$`) show that the roots for the differential equation `$Ay'' + Cy = 0$` are

`$$i\sqrt{C/A}$$`

2. Then solve the following ODE:

 `$$y'' + 4\pi 2y = 0$$`

subject to the initial conditions `$y(0)=4$` and `$y'(0)=10\pi$`.

## Resources

- Book (http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/getfile.aspx?file=B,1,N) section 3.3.

## Solution

1. Please compare your answer with your partner in class

2. Check your answer by entering the solution for `$y(0.4)$`
