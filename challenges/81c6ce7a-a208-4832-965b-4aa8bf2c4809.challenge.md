## Intro


  
## Online learning

[Vectors, what even are they?](https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs)

Chapter - Vectors and Matrices

- Section - Vectors

[Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors](https://youtu.be/k7RM-ot2NWY)

Chapter - Vectors and Matrices

- Section - Linear Combinations and Span





## Terminology

- vectors
- column vs row vectors
- vectors in `$\mathbb{R}^n$`
- vector space `$\mathbb{R}^n$` (no need for formal defition)
- zero vector
- vector addition
- scalar multiplication
- head-to-tail rule vs parallelogram rule
- linear combination of vectors
- span as noun vs span as verb


## Key points

- geometrical vector vs algebraical vector 
- at this point focus on `$\mathbb{R}^n$` other vector spaces come later
- be able to determine whether a vector is a linear combination of other vectors, i.e., when it belongs to their span
- be able to describe the span of a set of vectors
- be able to determine whether a set of vectors spans `$\mathbb{R}^n$`
- a set of `$n$` vectors from `$\mathbb{R}^m$` cannot span `$\mathbb{R}^m$` if `$n < m$`, its too few of them



## Exercises

1. find if a vector is a linear combination (in span), describe span, find if it spans whole space

## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing than from someone elses explanation.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however it is a waste of time for everybody if you do not aim higher.
