## Challenge
Express the given complex number in the exponential form `$z = r e^{i \theta}$`

1. `$z_1 = -2\pi i$`
1. `$z_2 = (3-i)^2$`
1. `$z_3 = \frac{2}{1+i}$`

## Resources
    
- Chapter 1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
In each case, you will obtain a solution in the form `$z = r e^{i \theta}$`.
For a cursory check of your answers, calculate `$r_1+r_2+\theta_3$` where `$-\pi/2 < \theta_3 < \pi/2$`, and compare your solutions with your partner in class.
