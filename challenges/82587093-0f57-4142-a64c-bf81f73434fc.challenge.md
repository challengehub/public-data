(PDF challenge 4.18)

## Comment

This challenge gives you useful practise of going the other way; determining a differential equation that describes a given solution.

## Challenge

Determine the 2nd-order linear differential equation which has the general solution

`$$
y = C_1 e^{-2t} + C_2 t e^{-2t} + t^3 - 3t
$$`

## Solution

You will end up with differential terms on the left side and a function of `$ t $` on the right side.
Please compare your answer with your partner in class.
To check your answer with challenge-hub, evaluate the right side of your equation by substituting the value `$t=0.4$`.
