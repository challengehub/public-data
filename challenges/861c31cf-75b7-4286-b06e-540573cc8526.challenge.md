## Comment

Note that we're working in radians here. From now on a factor of `$2 \pi$` will be included in the oscillations so that `$\sin(2 \pi t)$` will complete 1 cycle in 1 second.  (If you calculator defaults to degrees, be sure to change it to radians for this course.)


## Challenge
What is the frequency of `$\sin(2 \pi k t)$`, where `$t$` is time in seconds and `$k=1$`?
