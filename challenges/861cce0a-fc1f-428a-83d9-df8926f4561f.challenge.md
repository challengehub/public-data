title: Calculating the closed integral of a square in the complex plane

---

## Comment
The video gives a very nice introduction and I recommend you take the time to watch it and take detailed notes.

## Challenge
Evaluate the given integral along the indicated contour `$C$`.

`$$\oint_C z e^z dz$$` where `$C$` is the square with vertices `$ z=0$`, `$z=1$`, `$z = 1 + i$` and `$ z= i$`

## Resources
- Chapter 5.2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9qvNO9-XkE&list=PLi7yHjesblV0sSfZzWdSUXGO683n_nJdQ&index=21

## Solution Form
Your final answer will a complex number of the form `$x+iy$`. Enter `$x+y$` to check your answer.
