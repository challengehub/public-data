title: Obtaining the complex derivative of f(z) = 1/z

---

## Comment

Suppose the complex function `$f$` is defined in a neighborhood of a point `$z_{0}$`. The derivative of `$f$` at `$z_{0}$` denoted by `$f^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)$` is

`$$
f^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)=\lim _{\Delta z \rightarrow 0} \frac{f\left(z_{0}+\Delta z\right)-f\left(z_{0}\right)}{\Delta z}
$$`

provided this limit exists.

## Challenge
Use the above definition to find `$f'(z)$` for the given function:

`$$ f(z) = \frac1z$$`

## Solution Form
To check your answer, substitute `$z_0=3$` into your final answer to obtain a complex number of the form `$\alpha + i \beta$` then enter the value of `$\alpha+\beta$`.
