## Challenge
Work through sample problem 7/1 in the book.


## Resources
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9cc7sSm_g
- Section 7/1 to 7/5 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition

*Correction to book: Figure 7/9 should read `$\bm{\alpha} = \bm{\dot{\omega}} = \bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{\omega}$` (not `$\bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{r}$`)*


## Solution Form
Discuss any points you are unclear about with you partner or the teacher in the class.
