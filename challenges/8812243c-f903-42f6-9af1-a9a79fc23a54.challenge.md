## Comment
Let us make sure that everybody understands why the equation `$w^n = z$` has  exactly `$n$` solutions and how to find them. Here, `$n$` is a positive integer.

## Challenge
Compute all roots. Give the principal `$n$`th root in each case. Sketch the roots `$w_0,w_1, \dots, w_{n-1}$` on an appropriate circle centered at the origin.
  
a) `$(8)^\frac13$`

b) `$(1+i)^\frac15$`

c) `$\displaystyle \left(\frac{16i}{1+i}\right)^\frac18$`


## Resources
- Chapter 1.3 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/imaginary-and-complex-numbers#polar-form-of-complex-numbers)


## Solution Form
Each root can be reduced to the form `$\alpha+i\beta$`
To mark the challenge as complete, enter `$\beta$` of the 2nd root of (c), and please compare your answers with your partner in class.
