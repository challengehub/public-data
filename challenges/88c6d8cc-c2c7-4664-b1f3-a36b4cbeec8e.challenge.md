## Challenge
Answer question **7/74** in the book.

## Comment
Here you can connect force with inertia and moments. Remember the basic relation that a moment is given by *force* `$\times$` *distance*, and that the system is in equilibrium so all forces must balance.

## Resources
- Sections **7/9** and **7/10** of *Engineering Mechanics Dynamics* by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution form
To check your answer, enter the value of the y-axis force by *B*, substituting any of the following values into your final equation.
Your solution should have units of *Newtons*, but only enter the number, not the units.

- `$L = 10~\text{m}$`
- `$m = 2~\text{kg}$`
- `$R = 1.5~\text{m}$`
- `$\omega = 5~\text{rad}/\text{s}$`
