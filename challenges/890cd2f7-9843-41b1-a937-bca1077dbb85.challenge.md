## Comments
There are two things to watch out for in this challenge:
- We have defined the Laplace transform for a step function in the sense of `$U_c f(t-c)$`. So if `$f(t)=t$` we must evaluate for `$f(t-c)=t-c$`. If the function does not contain `$t$` then we simply do not need to subtract `$c$`.
- The `$t-c$` is essentially substituted in place of any `$t$` in the equation. So `$at$` will become `$a(t-c)$` and not `$at - c$`.

This challenge is interesting because unlike previous challenges, it is the first challenge where we really have no other option but to use the Laplace transform method, and so you can appreciate its power. In this challenge, we have a 2nd-order homogeneous equation (unforced oscillation) until `$t=5$` when we apply a constant force. You will find your answer leads to a constant oscillation. But how can it lead to a constant oscillation if we are constantly applying a force? Shouldn't the oscillation slowly increase in magnitude due to the energy that is being added to the system from the constant force being applied? The answer is of course no: we take just as much energy out of the system when the velocity is in the opposite direction to the force as we add to the system when the velocity is in the same direction as the applied force.

## Challenge
Solve

`$$
    y''+2y=U_5
$$`

for `$y$`, given initial conditions `$y(0)=0$` and `$y'(0)=0$`. 


## Solution Form
To check your solution, calculate `$y(t=7)$`.

Note that for `$t<5$`, the solution is zero. This is because there was no initial velocity and no initial acceleration, so there was no motion until a forcing was applied in terms of a constant force of `$1$` from `$t=5$`. If either of these had been non-zero, we would have had a non-zero value for `$t<5$`!

Optionally, you can try setting the initial conditions to non-zero values to see the effect this has on the final solution.
