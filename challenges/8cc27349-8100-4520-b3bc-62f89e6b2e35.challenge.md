## Comments
Just so that you are aware, you should know that there are various equivalent notations in use, and if you use the Fourier transform in your later career you will probably come across notations different to the ones used in this course. This is partly because Fourier analysis is applicable to a wide range of fields and each field tends to have its own conventions based on how the Fourier transform is interpreted physically (if at all) in that field.

In general, the Fourier transform is given by
`$$ \mathcal{F}f(\omega) = \sqrt{\frac{|b|}{(2 \pi)^{1-a}}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{i b \omega t} dt $$`

where `$a$` and `$b$` typically take on values such as 

`$$
\begin{array}{c|rr}
    \textbf{Case} & \textbf{a} & \textbf{b} \\
    \hline
    1 & 0 & 1 \\
    2 & 1 & -1 \\
    3 & -1 & 1 \\
    4 & 0 & -2\pi \\
\end{array}
$$`


## Challenge
This challenge is formed of two parts.

1. Write the Fourier transform using the four possible notations.

2. Add the points of the legitimate forms of Fourier notation below:

**1 point**: `$\displaystyle \mathcal{F}f(w)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i w t} f(t) dt$`

**2 points**: `$\displaystyle \mathcal{F}f(w)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i 2 \pi w t} f(t) dt$`

**4 points**: `$\displaystyle \mathcal{F}f(w)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i w t} f(t) dt$`

**8 points**: `$\displaystyle \mathcal{F}f(s)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i \pi s t} f(t) dt$`

**16 points**: `$\displaystyle \mathcal{F}f(w)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i 2 \pi w t} f(t) dt$`

**32 points**: `$\displaystyle \mathcal{F}f(s)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i s t} f(t) dt$`


## Solution Form
Please compare your solution to (1) with your partner in class.
To check your answer to part (2), enter the sum of points **as an integer**.
