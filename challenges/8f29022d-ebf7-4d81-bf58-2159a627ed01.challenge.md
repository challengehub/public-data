## Comment
The PDF in the resources goes into more detail than the videos on Khan academy, considering a greater range of cases. You may note that the particular solution is denoted by `$Y$` in the PDF while Sal Khan denotes it as `$y_p$` in his videos.

## Challenge
Using the method of undetermined coefficients, calculate the general solution to the ODE:
`$$y'' + 2y' = 6 e^{-2t}$$`

## Resources
- [Undetermined coefficients PDF](/api/v0/teachers/github.NanoScaleDesign/resources/public/ac15c611-7b7c-47ae-989a-cc4a5089f787.pdf/ac15c611-7b7c-47ae-989a-cc4a5089f787.pdf) *(These notes were developed by Zachary S. Tseng at Pennsylvania State University, USA (http://www.math.psu.edu/tseng/). Used in this course with kind permission.)*

## Solution
Assuming that the constants you find in your solution are all equal to 1, check your answer by calculating `$y(t=0.4)$` in each case. To check your answer, please subsume all constants on any term into the constant that you set to 1. For example, instead of `$y(t) = -2 C_1 e^{-t} + e^{-t}$`, write `$y(t) = C_1 e^{-t}$` where the two `$e^{-t}$` terms have been combined and the `$-2$` has been subsumed into the constant `$C_1$`, and then set `$C_1 = 1$` to check the answer.
