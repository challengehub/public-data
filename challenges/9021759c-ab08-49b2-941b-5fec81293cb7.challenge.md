## Challenge
Answer question 7/38.
Note that `$\omega_4$` is not given in the question but you may assume it has a value of `$0~\text{rad}/\text{s}$`.


## Resources
- Section 7/6 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution form
Your answer will consist of a vector `$\alpha \bm{\hat{i}} + \beta \bm{\hat{j}} + \gamma \bm{\hat{k}}$` in units of `$m/s$`.
To check your answer, calculate `$\alpha + 10 \beta + 100 \gamma$`.
