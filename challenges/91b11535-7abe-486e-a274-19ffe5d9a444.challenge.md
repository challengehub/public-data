## Challenge
Until now we have been considering real signals `$f(t)$`. This function can be written as a complex Fourier series in the form:


`$$
    f(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{i 2 \pi k t}
 $$`

What is the necessary relation between `$c_k$` and `$c_{-k}$` to produce an entirely real signal `$f(t)$`? Explain why.
