title: Finding complex values of Log((1+i)^6)

---

## Challenge
Find *all* complex values of `$$ln((1+i)^6)$$`

## Resources
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYxyemNSSm8
- Chapter 4.1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan, 1st edition


## Solution Form
You should have an infinite number of solutions in the form `$x+iy$`.
To check your answer, enter `$x+y$` where `$y$` is the smallest positive solution.
