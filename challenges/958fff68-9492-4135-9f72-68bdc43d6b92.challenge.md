title: Calculating the number of prey in a predator-prey system of equations

---

## Challenge
Considering the predator-prey system of equations below, calculate the number of prey at the point that the number of prey is increasing at a rate of 200 per month and there are 10 predators.

- `$\alpha=\gamma=100$`
- `$\beta=\delta=0.1$`

`$$
\begin{aligned}
  x' &= \alpha x+ \beta x y \\
  y' &= \delta xy - \gamma y
\end{aligned}
 $$`
