title: Showing the existence of complex limits

---

## Comments

The formal delta-epsilon definition of limits in a complex plane is something you should know from real analysis, but from a practical ("engineering") point of view, understanding that if `$f$` approaches two complex numbers `$L_{1} \neq L_{2}$` for two different curves or paths through `$z_{0}$`, then `$\lim _{z \rightarrow z_{0}} f(z)$` does not exist is probably the most important point here.

Example 1 in chapter 2.6 of the book in the resources gives a nice clear example.

## Challenge
Show that the following limits do *not* exist.

a) `$\displaystyle{\lim_{z \to 0}}\ \frac{z}{|z|}$` 
    
b) `$\displaystyle{\lim_{z \to 0}}\ \frac{\mathrm{Re}(z) \mathrm{Im}(z)}{{|z|}^2}$` 
    
c) `$\displaystyle{\lim_{z \to 0}}\ {({z}/{\bar{z}})}^2$`
