## Comments
The video in the resources includes an excellent example of using Fourier analysis in a scientific context, including its application in filters. I encourage you to watch until *24:15*. After this point Prof. Osgood goes on to describe the futility of trying to visualise convolution in the time-domain, however the graphics on convolution on Wikipedia [1] (especially [2a,2b]) I think go a little way to visualising what's happening in the time-domain.

For your reference, turbidity standards of 5, 50, and 500 Nephelometric Turbidity Units are shown here from left to right:

## Challenge
Using a few sentences and diagrams, describe an ideal low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filter. How can they be applied in the frequency domain to influence the signal in the time-domain?
