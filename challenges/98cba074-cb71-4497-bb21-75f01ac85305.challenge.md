## Comment

Complex numbers also feature very much in solving ordinary differential equations. This course assumes you are already familiar with this, but this challenge provides a refresher on the subject.

## Challenge
Obtain the general solution of the following homogeneous ordinary differential equation:

`$$ 3y'' + y = 0 $$`

## Resources
    
- Chapter 1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
To check your answer, assume all constants are 1 and calculate y(1)
