## Challenge
Consider the set `$S$` of discrete points in the complex plane defined by `$\{ \frac{i}n\}$`, `$ n= 1,2,3,\dots$`
Add the points of the terms which apply to `$S$` and *explain your reasoning clearly*:

1 point: **bounded**
2 points: **open**
4 points: **closed**
8 points: **connected**
