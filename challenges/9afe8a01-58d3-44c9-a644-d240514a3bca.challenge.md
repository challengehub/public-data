## Comments

Next we begin the real complex function theory, that is, we will study functions of a single complex variable. To do so
some terminology about sets in the complex plane is necessary.

## Challenge



1. Sketch the graphs of the given equations in the complex plane.

   a) `$|z-3i| = 2$`
   b) `${\rm Re}(z) = 1$`
   c) `${\rm Im}(z + 3i) = {\rm Re}(z + 1)$`

2. Sketch the set `$S$` of points in the complex plane satisfying the given inequality. Determine whether the set is open, closed, a domain, bounded or connected.

   a) `${\rm Re}(z) < -1$`
   b) `$-1 \leq {\rm Im}(z) < 4$`
   c) `$|z-i| > 1$`
   d) `$1< z < 1$` (no mistake here)

3. What are the boundary points of a deleted neighborhood of `$z_0$`?
4. What are the boundary points of the complex plane?




## Resources

- Check the textbook.

- Explore the Internet.


## Tips

- You learn more from trying and failing that from explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
