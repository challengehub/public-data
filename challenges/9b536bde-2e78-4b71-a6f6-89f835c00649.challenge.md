## Comments
Weighing fruit is an important part of fruit management. In this challenge you will learn how to weigh multiple fruit.

## Challenge

Write an equation that describes the weight of the bag of apples *w* as a function of the number of apples *n*: `$w(n)$`

You may neglect the weight of the bag and any worms in the apples.
