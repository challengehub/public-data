## Comments
Since this can be a little confusing, please be sure to fully read the listed resource and make sure you understand the reasoning and derivation.


## Challenge
A triangle function of general width can be defined as
`$$
    f(at)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 - a|t| & \text{for } a|t| < 1\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
$$`

The base-width of the triangle when `$a=1$` is `$2$` (ie, `$1-(-1)$`) and the half-base-width is `$1$`. What is the half-base-width for a triangle when `$a=2$`?
