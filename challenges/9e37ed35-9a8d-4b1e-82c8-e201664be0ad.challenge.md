## Challenge
The complex Fourier series of a function is given by 

`$$
    f(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{i 2 \pi k t}
 $$`

In the context of rotation on a complex plane, explain what the role of the `$c_k$` coefficients is. Explain how these coefficients influence the **magnitude** and **phase** of a given frequency.
