## Comments
Note that the video resource uses `$n$` to denote the `$n$`'th sample of the period and `$k$` to represent the `$k$`'th DFT coefficient.


## Challenge
The general formula to obtain the discrete Fourier transform coefficients with `$N$` samples can be written as

`$$ X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] W_N^{nk} $$`

Explain in detail how it is possible to re-write this as the sum of two DFT's of length `$N/2$`, one considering even entries of `$k$` and the other considering odd entries of `$k$`.
