title: Find the principle value of (1-sqrt(3)i)^i

---

## Comments

The YouTube video is worth watching to the end...

## Challenge
Find *the principle value* of `$$(1-\sqrt{3}i)^i$$` in the form `$x+iy$`.

## Resources
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tlHQOKMHGA
- Chapter 4.2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan, 1st edition


## Solution Form
You should have an infinite number of solutions in the form `$x+iy$`.
To check your answer, enter `$x+y$` of the principle value.
