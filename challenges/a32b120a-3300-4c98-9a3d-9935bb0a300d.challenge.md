## Terminology 
- complex mappings
- image of `$S$` under `$f$`
- pre-image
- parametric curve
- parametric equations
- parametrization
- line, line segment, ray, circle


## Comments

Graphs of real valued functions of a single real variable are common place. However
a **complex function of a complex variable** necesitates a bit more "complex" way of visualization. 


## Challenge



1. Sketch the curves.

    a) `$z(t) = (-1-i)(1-t) + (2+i)t, \hspace{0.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq 1 $`
    
    b) `$z(t) = (-1-i)(1-t) + (2+i)t, \hspace{0.3cm} -\infty \leq t \leq \infty $`
    
    c) `$z(t) = (-1-i)(1-t) + (2+i)t, \hspace{0.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq \infty $`
    
    d) `$z(t) = 3+i+e^{it}, \hspace{0.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$`
    
    e) `$z(t) = 2e^{it}, \hspace{0.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$`
    
    f) `$z(t) = 2e^{-it}, \hspace{0.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq \pi$`

## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
