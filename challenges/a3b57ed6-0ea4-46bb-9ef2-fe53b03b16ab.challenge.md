title: Linear mapping of a closed disk in a complex plane

---

## Comments

Linear functions are the easiest type of functions to visualize in complex plane. On the other hand, they play a crucial role in the concept of limit and differentiation. We will be working with them a lot and hence a good understanding of them is a *must*. 

## Challenge
Consider the set of points in the closed disk `$|z| \leq 1$` under the given linear mapping `$w = f(z)$`. Draw a graph showing the image of the closed disk under the given linear mapping:
    
a) `$f(z) = z + 3i$`

b) `$f(z) = 3iz$`
    
c) `$f(z) = 2z-i$`
