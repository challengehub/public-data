## Comments
Here you finally get the opportunity to practise solving ODE's using the powerful method of Laplace transformations. Please takes notes from all four videos listed in the resources section; they provide very useful examples of how to use this method, including related algebraic techniques that are commonly required to solve such challenges.


## Challenge
The spring equation you encountered in challenge \ref{sec:hooke} introduced you to the concept of oscillation of a mass on a spring. There, the equation to determine the displacement of the spring `$y$` from its equilibrium position was `$ y''+y=0 $`, which yields a solution `$y=C_1 \cos(t) + C_2 \sin(t)$`. This is free oscillation without external damping or driving, and it will oscillate according to the cosine and sine sum for all time (`$t$`). It is also possible to add a forcing term to the equation by making it non-homogeneous, such as in the form

`$$
    y'' + 4y = 2 \cos(3t)
$$`

Here the forcing varies with time `$t$` in the form of a cosine wave.

Use the Laplace transform method to solve the ODE in the above equation given a starting displacement of zero and an initial velocity of zero. You may use the table of Laplace transforms in the resources to help you.

A graph of the resulting oscillation is shown here:
