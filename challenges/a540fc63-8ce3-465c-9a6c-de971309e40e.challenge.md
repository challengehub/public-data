## Intro

We have already seen linear transformations from `$\mathbb R^n$` to `$\mathbb R^m$` in the first semester. At that time, we showed that every linear transformation is a matrix transformation and vice-versa. Hence, we could use the properties of matrices to show lots of interesting and useful things about linear transformations. In fact, as we discover in this challenge, the linear transformations from `$V$` to `$W$` are just a further generalizations of the matrix transformations and their behavior and properties follow that of matrices.


## Terminology

- linear transformation
- zero transformation
- identity transformation
- composition
- invertible, inverse
- kernel
- range
- rank
- nullity
- one-to-one
- onto
- isomorphism, isomorphic
 

## Theorems

- properties of linear transformations
- linear transformation maps spanning sets onto spanning sets 
- composition of linear transformations is a linear transformation
- kernel and range are subspaces
- The Rank Theorem
- linear transformation is one-to-one iff ker`$(T)=\{\bf 0\}$`
- If dim`$V =$` dim `$W$`, then linear transformation `$T: V \to W$` is one-to-one iff it is onto.
- one-to-one linear transformations map linearly independent sets onto linearly independent sets
- If dim`$V =$` dim `$W$`, then one-to-one linear transformation `$T: V \to W$` maps basis onto basis.
- Linear transformation is invertible iff it is one-to-one and onto. 
- Two finite dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic iff they have the same dimension.


## Key points

- linear transformations are generalization of matrix transformations with all of its benefits
- there is an interconnection between rank/nullity (range/kernel) and onto/one-to-one properties
- If dim`$V =$` dim `$W$`, then one-to-one linear transformation `$T: V \to W$` maps basis onto basis.
- Linear transformation is invertible iff it is one-to-one and onto.
- Finite dimensional vector spaces of the same dimension `$n$` are all the same! (i.e., all same as `$\mathbb R^n$`)

## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing than from an immediate explanation.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however it is a waste of time for everybody if you do not aim higher.
