## Challenge
Consider a mass connected to two perpendicular poles as shown below.

![iyz](/api/v0/teachers/github.NanoScaleDesign/resources/public/4206ab62-e156-461a-afae-439c762c47bf.png/4206ab62-e156-461a-afae-439c762c47bf.png)

The length of each rod is *L* and each rod can be considered to have negligable mass.

**a)** Determine the inertia `$I_{yz}$` about the origin *O*.
**b)** In a sentence of two, briefly explain your reasoning for how you obtained the answer.


## Resources
- Section **7/9** of *Engineering Mechanics Dynamics* by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution form
To check your answer, substitute any of the following values into your final equation.
Your solution should have units of `$\text{kg}~\text{m}^2$`, but only enter the number, not the units.

- `$L = 2~\text{m}$`
- `$m = 3~\text{kg}$`
