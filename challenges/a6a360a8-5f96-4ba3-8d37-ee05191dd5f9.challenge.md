## Comments

Unlike real roots the complex roots make a complete picture when dealing with power/polynomial equations. The next exercises give more in depth understanding of complex roots. Defend your answers with sound mathematics.

## Challenge

1. Suppose `$n$` denotes a nonnegative integer. Determine the values of `$n$` such that `$z^n = 1$` possesses only real solutions. 
2. A real number can have a complex `$n$`th root. Can a nonreal complex number have a real `$n$`th root?
3. Suppose `$w$` is located in the first quadrant and is a cube root of a complex number `$z$`. Can there exist a second cue root of `$z$` located in the first quadrant? 
4. Suppose `$z$` is a complex number that possesses a fourth root `$w$` that is neither real nor pure imaginary. Explain why the remaining fourrth roots are neither real nor pure imaginary.
