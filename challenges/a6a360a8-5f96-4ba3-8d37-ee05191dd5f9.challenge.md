## Comments

Unlike real roots the complex roots make a complete picture when dealing with power/polynomial equations. The next exercises give more in depth understanding of complex roots. Defend your answers with sound mathematics.

## Challenge

1. Suppose `$n$` denotes a nonnegative integer. Determine the values of `$n$` such that `$z^n = 1$` possesses only real solutions. 

2. A real number can have a complex `$n$`th root. Can a nonreal complex number have a real `$n$`th root?

3. Suppose `$w$` is located in the first quadrant and is a cube root of a complex number `$z$`. Can there exist a second cue root of `$z$` located in the first quadrant? 

4. Suppose `$z$` is a complex number that possesses a fourth root `$w$` that is neither real nor pure imaginary. Explain why the remaining fourrth roots are neither real nor pure imaginary.


## Resources

- Check the textbook.
 
- Go back to previous challenges.

- Explore the Internet.

## Tips

- You learn more from trying and failing that from explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
