## Comments

We say that two mappings `$f$` and `$g$` **commute** if `$ f\circ g(z) = g \circ f(z)$` for all `$z$`. That is, two mappings commute if the order in which you compose them does not change the mapping.

An *identity magnification* could be considered as a magnification of "1".

## Challenge

a) Can a translation and a non-identity rotation commute?

b) Can a translation and a non-identity magnification commute?
    
c) Can a non-identity rotation and a non-identity magnification commute?

## Solution Form
To check your solution, sum the points for the following statements and enter *as an integer*:

**1 point** Translation and non-identitiy rotation *can* commute
**2 points** Translation and non-identitiy rotation *cannot* commute
**4 points** Translation and non-identitiy magnification *can* commute
**8 points** Translation and non-identitiy magnification *cannot* commute
**16 points** Non-identity rotation and non-identitiy magnification *can* commute
**32 points** Non-identity rotation and non-identitiy magnification *cannot* commute
