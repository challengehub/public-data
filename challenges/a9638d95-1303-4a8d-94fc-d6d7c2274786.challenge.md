title: Calculating the complex integral of |z|^2 on the line from (-1+i) to (1)

---

## Comment
The video gives a very nice introduction and I recommend you take the time to watch it and take detailed notes.

## Challenge
Evaluate the given integral along the indicated contour `$C$`.

`$$\int_C |z|^2 dz$$` where `$C$` is the straight line from `$z=-1+i$` to `$z=1$`
