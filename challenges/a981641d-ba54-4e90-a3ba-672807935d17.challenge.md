## Comments
The Laplace Transform is a powerful technique that has many uses beyond solving ODE's. It can however appear a bit abstract at first. Becoming comfortable with controlling and manipulating the transform will help provide confidence when using it to solve ODE's. The four videos in the resources above provide an excellent starting point for getting you comfortable with this powerful technique.

## Challenge
Calculate `$ \mathcal{L}\{\cos(a t)\} $`

## Resources
Videos: The *four* Khan-academy videos starting at https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations/laplace-transform/laplace-transform-tutorial/v/laplace-transform-1

## Checking your solution
Substitute `$s=2$` and `$a=4 into your final solution.
