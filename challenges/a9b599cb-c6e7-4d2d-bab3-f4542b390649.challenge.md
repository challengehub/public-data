## Comments
In our final study of the application of Laplace transform to solving ODE's, we will look at convolution. This is partly because this is a useful technique for solving ODE's, but also because it, like Laplace transforms, has a much wider range of applications than solving ODE's. So while we are focusing on using Laplace transform and convolution to solve ODE's, my hope is that your familiarity with these topics in this context will make future related topics in other contexts more accessable.

## Challenge
Evaluate the following expressions:

`$$
y(t) = 1 * \cos t
$$`

## Solution Form
To check your answer, evaluate `$y(0.8)$`.
