## Challenge
Consider helium gas stored in a silicon spherical container at `$25\degree\text{celsius}$` `$4~\text{bar}$` pressure, with an inner radius of `$100~\text{mm}$` and outer radius of `$110~\text{mm}$`. Calculate the rate at which it escapes from the container. Assume a diffusion coefficient of helium in the walls of the container of `$4 \times 10^{-14}~\text{m}^2/\text{s}$` and a solubility of Helium in Silicon of `$4.5 \times 10^{-4}~\text{kmol}/\text{m}^3/\text{bar}$`. Since the thickness of the walls is similar to the radius, you cannot approximate the surface as being flat, as was done in the previous challenge. In particular, the surface area is now a function of radius.
