## Challenge
  
Find a general formula for the `$n$`th root of unity (i.e. "1").

Using your general formula, find `$n$` `$n$`th roots of unity for `$n= 3$`, `$n= 5$` and plot the roots in the complex plane.

## Resources

## Solution Form
To mark the challenge as complete, enter Arg`$(z)$` of the 5th root of `$1^{1/5}$`, and compare your answers with your partner in class.
