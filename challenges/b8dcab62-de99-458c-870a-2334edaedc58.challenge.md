title: Find the Taylor series of e^z centred at 2i

---

## Comment
If you know the Maclaurin series for `$e^z$` then this can save you time.

## Challenge
Find the Taylor series of `$e^z$` centred at `$2i$`.

## Resources
- Chapter 6.2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
Considering each term in the series `$k=0,1,2,...$`, sum the terms `$k=0,1,2$` assuming `$z=2+2i$`.
Then enter that sum to check your answer.
