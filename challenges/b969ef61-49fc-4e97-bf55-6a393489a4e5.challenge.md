## Comments

It is possible to add a damping term *B* to Hooke's law that is proportional to the velocity of the movement. You could imagine this as a friction term, with the force from friction becoming stronger as the velocity increases.

## Challenge

`$$ A \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + B \frac{dy}{dt} + C y = 0 $$`

Show that, assuming that all solutions to a 2nd-order differential equation of the form above will have solutions `$y(t) = e^{rt}$`, the value of r can in principle be determined by solving the following a quadratic equation of the form

`$$ A r^2 + Br + C = 0 $$`


## Resources
