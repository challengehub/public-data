## Comments

It is possible to add a damping term *B* to Hooke's law that is proportional to the velocity of the movement. You could imagine this as a friction term, with the force from friction becoming stronger as the velocity increases.

## Challenge

Show that, assuming that all solutions to a 2nd-order differential equation of the form above will have solutions y(t) = e^{rt}, the value of r can in principle be determined by solving the following a quadratic equation of the form
