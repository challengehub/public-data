## Challenge

Solve the following ODE:

`$$y'' âˆ’ y' + y = 0$$`

subject to initial conditions `$y(0)=1$` and `$y'(0)=2$`. One of the integration constants is `$\sqrt{3}$`. You will need to find the other one.

## Resources

- Book (http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/GetFile.aspx?file=B,1,N) section 3.3.
- Text: http://www.its.caltech.edu/~roberto/FSRI/Lecture/fsri_math_2011_Aug_4.pdf

## Solution

To check your answer, evaluate `$y(0.4)$`.
