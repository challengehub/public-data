title: 'Independence of path: Integral of e^z on the contour 3t^2+i(t^4+t^2+1) for
  0<=t<=1'

## Comment
Do not simply calculate this integral naïvely. There is a simpler way than first glance suggests.

## Challenge
Calculate the integral
`$$\displaystyle{\int_{C} e^z} \ dz$$`
where `$C:z(t)=3t^2+i(t^4+t^2+1), ~ 0 \leq t \leq 1$`


## Resources
- Chapter 5.4 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
You will have a final answer that can be written in the form `$x+iy$`.
To check your answer, enter `$x$`.
