## Challenge

Add the points of the sentences that **use signalling** to carry the reader from one sentence to the next

**1 point**: A way to melt steel is to raise the temperature of the furnace. Then the length will increase.

**2 points**: A way to melt steel is to raise the temperature of the furnace. Then the length of the steel will increase.

**4 points**: The direction of the ship is controlled by the rudder or by adjusting the power of the engines. Although it can take a long time, these methods can help control the direction.

**8 points**: The statistical approach is thought to be better; although less accurate, computational time is saved.

**16 points**: A statistical approach is often used, which saves computational time.

**32 points**: The fuel cell cannot operate above 120 `$^\text{o}\text{C}$`. Damage can occur.

**64 points**: The pressure is proportional to the force applied. We must also think about the area.
