## Comments
The approach for deadling with non-homogeneous systems is very similar to that for dealing with homogeneous systems, but you just have to remember to add the forcing term at the end. For example, considering an equation similar to before, but this time with a cosine forcing term:

`$$
    y''' - 2y'' + 3y' - 4y = \cos t
$$`

We have

`$$
    x_4 - 2 x_3 + 3 x_2 - 4 x_1 = \cos t \\
    x_3' - 2 x_2' + 3 x_1' - 4 x_1 = \cos t
$$`

By comparison we still have `$x'_1 = x_2$` and `$x'_2 = x_3$` but now when we replace `$x_4$` with `$x'_3$` and re-arrange we have
`$$
   x_3' = \cos t + 4 x_1 - 3 x_2 + 2 x_3
$$`

leading to a final system of equations of the form

`$$
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1' \\
            x_2' \\
            x_3'
        \end{array}
    \right)
    =
    \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 \\
            4 & -3 & 2
        \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            x_1 \\
            x_2 \\
            x_3
        \end{array}
    \right)
    +
    \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            0 \\
            0 \\
            \cos t
        \end{array}
    \right)
$$`
