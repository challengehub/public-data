title: Calculate the derivative of cos(ie^z)

---

## Challenge
Calculate the derivative with respect to `$z$` of`$$\cos(ie^z)$$`

## Resources

## Solution Form
Ignoring any imaginary numbers (substituting them for 1), substitute `$z=2$` into your answer and enter the resulting number.
For example, if your answer is `$i e^{iz}$`, you would enter the numerical value given by `$e^2$`.
