## Comment

As it turns out it is quite useful to express complex numbers (vectors) using polar coordinates. 
At first let us try to do some basic calculations.

## Challenge
1. Express `$z$` in polar form using Arg`$(z)$` [ie, `$r(\cos(\theta)+i \sin(\theta)$`]

   a) `$z=3$`
   b) `$z=3i$`
   c) `$z=-3$`
   d) `$z=-3i$`
   e) `$z=1+i$`
   f) `$z=-2-2\sqrt{3}i$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1.3 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/imaginary-and-complex-numbers#polar-form-of-complex-numbers)

## Solution Form
To mark this challenge as complete, after completing (a)-(f), enter the *imaginary* part of your solution to (f).
