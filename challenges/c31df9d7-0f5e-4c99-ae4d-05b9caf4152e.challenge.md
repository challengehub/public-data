## Comments

Linear functions are the easiest type of functions to visualize in complex plane. On the other hand, they play a crucial role in the concept of limit and differentiation. We will be working with them a lot and hence a good understanding of them is a *must*. 

## Challenge
1. Prove that the composition of two translations `$T_1(z) = z + b_1$`, `$b_1 \neq  0$` and `$T_2 (z) = z + b_2$`, `$b_2 \neq  0$` is a translation. Does the order of composition matter?

2. Prove that the composition of two rotations `$R_1(z) = a_1z $`, `$|a_1| = 1$` and `$R_2 (z) = a_2z$`, `$|a_2| = 1$` is a rotation. Does the order of composition matter? 

3. Prove that the composition of two magnifications  `$M_1(z) = a_1z $`, `$a_1 > 0$` and `$M_2 (z) = a_2z$`, `$a_2> 0$` is a magnification. Does the order of composition matter?

## Solution Form
To check your solution, sum the points for the following statements and enter *as an integer*:

**1 point** Order matters for translation
**2 points** Order does not matter for translation
**4 points** Order matters for rotation
**8 points** Order does not matter for rotation
**16 points** Order matters for magnification
**32 points** Order does not matter for magnification
