## Comments
Bad news. Most ODE's cannot be solved. But we can understand the nature of the solution even if we can't write it's equation. This is why direction-fields (or slope-fields) are powerful tools. Here you can learn how to harness that power.

## Challenge
Draw the direction field for the equation

`$$ y'=x $$`
