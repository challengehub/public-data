## Comments
Being able to identify linear and non-linear ODE's will help you understand how to approach different problems.

Generally speaking, the differential equation is linear if the functions and orders of the differentials are linear. For example, 

`$$ y'' - 4yx = ln x - y $$`

can be shown to be linear. Rearranging to collect all the `$y$`-terms together:
`$$ y'' - 4yx + y = ln x $$`
the dependent variable `$y$` and its derivatives are each of the first degree and depend only on a constant or the independent variable.

An example of a non-linear equation however would be
`$$ 5 + yy' = x - y $$`
or
`$$ yy' + y = x - 5 $$`
The fact that `$y'$` is multiplied by `$y$` results in a non-linear equation in `$y$`.




## Challenge
Sum the points corresponding to the equations that are linear. Write clearly the reason for your choice of linear or non-linear equations.

**1 point**: `$\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt} = 5t^3 + 3 $`

**2 points**: `$\displaystyle cos(y) y'''(t) - y(t) = 25 $`

**4 points**: `$\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt} \frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = \frac{t^{-2}}{3} $`

**8 points**: `$\displaystyle y'(t) - sin(y(t)) = 0 $`

**16 points**: `$\displaystyle y'(t) - y(t) = 0 $`

**32 points**: `$\displaystyle t y'(t) - y(t) = 0 $`
