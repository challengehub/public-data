## Challenge
Consider rocket thrust where exhaust is emitted at a speed of `$220$` m/s. The force on the rocket due to the thrust alone is `$400$` N.

Calculate the rate of increase of the mass of the rocket `$\dot{m}$` with time.


## Resources
- Section 4/7 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution Form

Enter your final answer in units of kg/s.
