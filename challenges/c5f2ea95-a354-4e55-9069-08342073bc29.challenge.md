## Comments

There is a lot we could learn about elementary functions. However, what we need in this course is some basic understanding how 
these functions work and what to expect from them.






## Challenge

1. Prove that `$\ln{(z_1 z_2)} = \ln{z_1} + \ln{z_2}$` for all non-zero complex numbers `$z_1$` and `$z_2$`. 

2. Find `$z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb C$` such that `$\operatorname{Ln}(z_1z_2) = \not \operatorname{Ln}z_1 + \operatorname{Ln}z_2$`.


3. Prove that `$a^{z_1} / a^{z_2} = a^{z_1 - z_2}$` for all `$z_1, z_2 \in \mathbb C$`.

4. Find `$z_1, z_2, a \in \mathbb C$` such that the principal values `$(z_1z_2)^a = \not  {z_1}^a {z_2}^a$`.


5. Using the definitions prove that:

   a) `$\sinh{(iz)} = i\sinh{z} $`
   
   b) `$\cosh{(iz)} = \cosh{z} $`










## Resources

- Check the textbook.


- Explore the Internet.


## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
