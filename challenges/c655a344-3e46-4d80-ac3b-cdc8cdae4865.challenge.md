## Challenge

Find the image of the given set under the given composition of a linear function with the squaring function:

The circular arc `$|z| =2$`, `$0 \leq {\rm arg}(z) \leq \frac\pi2$`; `$f(z) = \frac14 e^{i\frac\pi4} z^2$`

    
## Resources
    
- Chapter 2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
As a simple check, enter the **maximum value of `$v$`** of the image.
Please compare your drawing of the set and its image in class.
