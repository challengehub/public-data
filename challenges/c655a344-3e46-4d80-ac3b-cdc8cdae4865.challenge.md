title: Drawing the set and image of the circular arc |z| = 2, 0 <= arg(z) <= pi/2;
  f(z) = 1/4 e^(I pi/4) z^2

---

## Challenge

Find the image of the given set under the given composition of a linear function with the squaring function:

The circular arc `$|z| =2$`, `$0 \leq {\rm arg}(z) \leq \frac\pi2$`; `$f(z) = \frac14 e^{i\frac\pi4} z^2$`

    
## Resources

## Solution Form
As a simple check, enter the **maximum value of `$v$`** of the image.
Please compare your drawing of the set and its image in class.
