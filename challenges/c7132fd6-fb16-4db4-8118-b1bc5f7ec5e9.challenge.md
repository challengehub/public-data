## Comment
Being able to reverse the Laplace transform is a crucial skill required for its application in solving ODE's. It can be a little confusing at first however, so I recommend to take your time to understand the essential steps involved thoroughly, as this will then give you greater confidence when you come to apply this to solving ODE's. To this end, the video listed in the resource is a fantastic introduction to this.

Note: it can be helpful to remember that if you're shifting the transform, perform the transform and *then* apply the shift.

## Challenge
Determine the function `$f(t)$` by finding the inverse of the following Laplace transform:

`$$
F(s)=\frac{6}{(2+s)^4}
$$`

## Solution
To check your solution, enter `$t=2$` into the final equation.
