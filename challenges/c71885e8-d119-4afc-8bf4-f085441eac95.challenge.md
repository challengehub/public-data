## Comments

Unlike real roots the complex roots make a complete picture when dealing with power/polynomial equations. The next exercises give more in depth understanding of complex roots. Defend your answers with sound mathematics.

## Challenge

Suppose `$w$` is located in the first quadrant on the real-complex plane and is a cube root of a complex number `$z$`. Can there exist a second cube root of `$z$` located in the first quadrant? Explain your answer.
