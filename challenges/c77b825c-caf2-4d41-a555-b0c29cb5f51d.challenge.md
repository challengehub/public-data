title: Understanding the terms of a predator-prey system of equations

---

## Comments
Until now we have considered linear forms of systems of equations, but it is possible to have non-linear systems too. The predator-prey systems of equations are one good example.

## Challenge
The predator-prey relations are given in the form

`$$
\begin{aligned}
  x' &= \alpha x+ \beta x y \\
  y' &= \delta xy - \gamma y
\end{aligned}
 $$`
 
Explain each term of the equations above.
