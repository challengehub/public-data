## Challenge
Question 7/73 in the book asks you to calculate the bending moment acting on each rod at it's base. The solution is given in the book.

Physically, what does this bending moment mean? How would this bending moment cause the rod to change shape or orientation if the equilibrium forces were not strong enough to hold it in place? Please draw a diagram to support your assertion.
