## Comments
Practically, the DFT is calculated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The reason is that the number of operations grows with the square of the number of samples which is unsustainable for typical signals.

The PDF in the resources is based on slides developed by Prof. Maraso Yamashiro for the 2015 class on Fourier Analysis and highlights this problem quantitatively.

## Challenge
Considering a signal `$f$` sampled at 22 kHz, how many multiplications are required to calculate `$F$` in the calculation `$\bm{\hat{f}} = F \bm{f}$`?
