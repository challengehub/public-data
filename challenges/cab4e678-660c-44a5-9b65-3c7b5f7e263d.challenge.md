## Challenge
Answer question **B/18** in the book.  Please fully derive your answer, except you may use the fact that `$I_{xx}$` for each rod is `$m L^2/6$`.


## Resources
- **Appendix B** of *Engineering Mechanics Dynamics* by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution form
To check your answer, evalulate the length of the rod if the radius of the disk is 3 metres.
