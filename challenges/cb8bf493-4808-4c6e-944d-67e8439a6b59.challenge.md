## Challenge
Consider a sealed box made up entirely of gas *A* with mass `$m_A = 6$` g/mole. The temperature of the gas and box system is `$300 K$` and the gas exerts 1 atmosphere pressure on the walls of the box.

Next, consider another gas *B* with mass `$m_B = 18$` g/mole is added to the box, without changing the amount of gas *A*. Now the pressure on the walls of the box is 1.5 atmospheres. The temperature and volume of the box are unchanged.

What is the density of gas *A* in the box? You may assume an ideal gas.

## Resources

- Sections 14.1.1 to 14.1.2 of *Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer* by F. Incropera et. al., 7th edition
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FLv0uxLrDI

## Solution Form
Enter the density of gas *A* in the box in units of `$kg/m^3$`.
You need only enter the number, not the units.
