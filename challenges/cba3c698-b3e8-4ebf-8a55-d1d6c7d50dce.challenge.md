title: Converting the polar representation of complex numbers into a Cartesian representation

---

## Comment

As it turns out it is quite useful to express complex numbers (vectors) using polar coordinates. 
## Challenge

Write the complex number `$\displaystyle  z=6e^{i \frac{\pi}8}$` in the form `$\alpha + i \beta$`.
