## Comment

As it turns out it is quite useful to express complex numbers (vectors) using polar coordinates. 
At first let us try to do some basic calculations.

## Challenge

Write the complex number `$\displaystyle  6\left(\cos \frac{\pi}8 + i \sin \frac{\pi}8 \right)$` in the form `$\alpha + i \beta$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1.3 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/imaginary-and-complex-numbers#polar-form-of-complex-numbers)

## Solution Form
To mark this challenge is complete, enter `$\alpha + \beta$`.
For a more rigourous check, please check in class.
