title: Factoring iz^2 - z + i = 0

---

## Comments
Here we start to look at some basic applications in mathematics of complex numbers.

## Challenge
Solve the given quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
*Then factor the polynomial.*

`$iz^2 - z + i = 0$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1.6 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
You will obtain two roots of the form `$a+ib$`.
To check your answer, calculate the magnitude of the smallest root.
Please compare your final factored polynomial with your partner in class.
