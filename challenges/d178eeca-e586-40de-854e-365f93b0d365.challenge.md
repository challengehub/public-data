title: Identifying autonomous differential equations

---

## Challenge
Add the points of the autonomous differential equations in the following list:

1 point: `$y' = cos(y)-5$`

2 points: `$y' = cos(y)/x - 5$`

4 points: `$y' = cos(y)/x - 5/x$`

8 points: `$y^2 = y' y+5$`

16 points: `$x y' = 5 y$`

32 points: `$y' = 1$`
