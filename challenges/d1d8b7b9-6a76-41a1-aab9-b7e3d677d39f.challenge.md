## Comments

It is not necessary to follow the full derivation in the suggested resource.

## Challenge

Solve the equation

`$$ y'' - 2y' + y = 0 $$`

subject to the initial conditions `$y(0) = 5$` and `$y'(0) = 6$`.

## Resources

- Book (http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/GetFile.aspx?file=B,1,N) from section 3-4
- Text: http://www.its.caltech.edu/~roberto/FSRI/Lecture/fsri_math_2011_Aug_4.pdf

## Solution

To check your answer, solve for `$y(1)$`.
