## Comment
See if you can use geometry to obtain roots beyond the principle root.

## Challenge
  
Find all solutions to the equation `$$z^4 + 1 = 0$$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1.3 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/imaginary-and-complex-numbers#polar-form-of-complex-numbers)


## Solution Form
Each root can be reduced to the form `$\alpha+i\beta$`
To mark the challenge as complete, enter `$\beta$` of the principle root, and please compare your answers with your partner in class.
