## Comments
In reality, growth is usually not unlimited. This is where the logistic equation comes in useful.


## Challenge
Assuming there is no-limit on growth, a given bacteria would be able to reproduce at such a rate that the amount of bacteria measured in mg increases by 20% every 25 hours. However, due to environmental factors the limiting (maximum) amount of bacteria that can exist in the system at any one time is 400 mg. Assuming an initial amount of bacteria of 20 mg, how much time must one wait to reach 100 mg of bacteria?
