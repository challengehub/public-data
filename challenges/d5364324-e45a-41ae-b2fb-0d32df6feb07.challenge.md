## Challenge
Calculate the convolution of `$f(t)=t$` with `$g(t)=e^{-|t|}$`.

*Hint 1: `$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \text{(even function)} = 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} \text{(even function)}$`.*

*Hint 2: You will get the same answer irrespective of which function you designate as "f" or "g", but one way is easier than the other to compute.*


## Solution Form
To check your answer, substitute `$t=1.5$` into your final answer to calculate `$(f \star g)(1.5)$`.
