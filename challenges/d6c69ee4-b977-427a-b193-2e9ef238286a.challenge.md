title: Calculate the Laurent Series of 1/(z(z-3)) for the annular domain 0<|z|<3

---

## Comment
The video in the resources below is really good and provides a clearer walk-through of the technique than the book. 

## Challenge
Expand `$\displaystyle f(z) = \frac1{z(z-3)}$` in a Laurent series valid for the annular domain `$0<|z|<3$`. Show that the resulting Laurent series can be written as

`$$f(z)=\sum_{n=-1}^\infty -\frac{z^n}{a_n}$$`

where `$a_n$` is a number dependent on `$n$`.
