## Challenge
Considering air as a mixture of two gases (`$O_2$` and `$N_2$`), situated in a closed, cylindrical container with its axis vertical and with opposite ends maintained at different temperatures. Assume the total pressure of the air is uniform throughout the container.

Consider each of the following conditions:

**a)** The bottom surface is colder than the top surface
**b)** The top surface is colder than the bottom surface

Add the points for the following **true** statements:

**1 point** There is motion of the air in case (A)

**2 points** There is no motion of the air in case (A)

**4 points** There is motion of the air in case (B)

**8 points** There is no motion of the air in case (B)

**16 points** There is diffusive mass transfer inside the cylinder in case (A)

**32 points** There is no diffusive mass transfer inside the cylinder in case (A)

**64 points** There is diffusive mass transfer inside the cylinder in case (B)

**128 points** There is no diffusive mass transfer inside the cylinder in case (B)
