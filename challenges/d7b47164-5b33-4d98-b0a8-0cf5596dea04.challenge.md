## Challenge
Considering the following ODE describing acceleration as a function of velocity and the graviational constant `$g=9.81$`m/s:

`$$ \dot{v} = g - v^2 $$`

1. Sketch a direction field to show the behaviour of solutions to this ODE. In particular, what values of `$v$` will lead to stable solutions?

2. What type of ODE is this?


## Solution Form
1. To check your answer, calculate `$\alpha + 10 \beta$` where `$\alpha$` is the value of the stable solution and `$\beta$` is the value of the unstable solution. Then please compare the graph with your partner in class.

2. Please compare your solution with your partner in class.
