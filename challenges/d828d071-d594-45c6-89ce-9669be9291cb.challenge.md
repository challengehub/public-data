## Challenge
Determine the angular velocity `$\dot{\theta}$` of the spheres in question 4/28 in the book, the moment before they touch. 


## Resources
- Section 4/1 to 4/5 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution Form
You should obtain an algebraic expression for `$\dot{\theta}$`. To check your expression, please substitute any or all of the following quantities into your solution and enter your solution in rad/s.
- `$m_0=1$` kg
- `$v_0=1000$` m/s
- `$b=1.5$` m
- `$m=4$` kg
