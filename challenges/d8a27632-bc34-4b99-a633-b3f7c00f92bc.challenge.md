## Challenge
Calculate the **torque** of the particles in question 4/1 in the book, relative to the **centre-of-mass**.


## Resources
- Section 4/4 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution Form
To check your answer, assuming `$d=1$` metre, `$m=1$` kg and `$f=1$` N, enter the magnitude of the angular momentum vector pointing in the `$y$`-direction.
