## Comments
The exponential term is central to much of this subject. It is worth taking some time to appreciate exactly where it comes from.


## Challenge
Generally speaking, the derivative of `$a^t$` is proportional to `$a^t$`. Using this general starting point, write a paragraph to explain 
**a)** what is so special about the case when `$a=e$`, the exponential function, and 
**b)** what happens when `$a$` deviates from from the value `$e$`.
