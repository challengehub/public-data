## Terminology

- polar coordinates
- polar form/representation of a complex number
- argument of a complex number
- principal value of argument/ principal argument
- multiplication and division in polar form
- integer powers in polar form
- de Moivre's formula

## Comments

As it turns out it is quite useful to expess complex numbers (vectors) using polar coordinates. 
At first let us try to do some basic calculations.

## Challenge

1. Express `$z$` in polar form using Arg`$(z)$`.

   a) `$z=3$`
   b)`$z=3i$`
   c) `$z=-3$`
   d) `$z=-3i$`
   e) `$z=i+1$`
   f)`$z=-2-2\sqrt{3}i$`

2. Write the complex number `$\displaystyle  5\left(\cos \frac{7\pi}6 + i \sin \frac{7\pi}6 \right)$` in the form `$a + ib$`. 
   (Use calculator as necessary.)


3. Evaluate the following expressions. You may express your answer in polar form.

   a) `$z=(\sqrt{3}-i)^{11}$`
   b) `$z=(-2-2i)^{-9}$`

- Check textbook

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/imaginary-and-complex-numbers#polar-form-of-complex-numbers)

- Explore the Internet.

## Tips

- To deal with complex numbers in polar coordinates it is quite useful 
to recall as much as possible about the functions sine and cosine and 
trigonometric formulas they satisfy.

- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
