## Comments

As it turns out it is quite useful to expess complex numbers (vectors) using polar coordinates.

## Challenge

Express `$z$` in polar form using Arg`$(z)$`.
1. `$z=3$`
2. `$z=3i$`
3. `$z=-3$`
4. `$z=-3i$`
5. `$z=i+1$`
6. `$z=-2-2\sqrt{3}i$`

Evaluate the following expressions. You may express your answer in polar form.
7. `$z=(\sqrt{3}-i)^{11}$`
8. `$z=(-2-2i)^{-9}$`


9. Find `$z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb C$` so that Arg`$(z_1z_2) \ne {\rm Arg}(z_1) + {\rm Arg}(z_2)$`

10. How are the complex numbers `$z_1$` and `$z_2$` related if arg`$(z_1) ={\rm arg }(z_2)$`?

11. Student A states that, even though she can't find it in the text, she shinks that `$arg(\overline z) = - {\rm arg}(z)$`. For example, she says, if `$z = 1+i$`, then `$\overline z = 1-i$` and arg`$(z) = \frac \pi 4$` and `${\rm arg}(\overline z)= - \frac \pi 4$`. Student B disagrees because he feels that he has a counterexample: If `$z =i$`, then `$\overline z = - i$`; we can take arg`$(i) = \frac\pi2$` and arg`$(-i) = \frac{3\pi}2$` and so `${\rm arg}(i) \neq {\rm arg}(-i)$`. Take sides and defend your position.
