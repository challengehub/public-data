## Intro

To be able to use determinants efficiently  we study the relationships between the determinant and the matrix operations. We can then use determinants to solve various problems related to  solutions of linear systems, inverse of a matrix or geometry.



## Terminology

- adjoint of a matrix
- the cross (vector) product
- Vandermonde determinant
 

## Theorems


- determinant of elementary matrices
- determinant and invertibility
- determinants and matrix operations
- Cramer's rule
- inverse of a matrix in terms of adjoint





## Key points

- determinant and invertibility 
- interaction of determinant and matrix operations
- cross product



## Challenge

1.  Use Theorem 4.6 to find all values of `$k$` for which `$A = \left[ \begin{matrix} k& k & 0  \\ k^2& 2 & k  \\ 0& k & k \end{matrix}\right] $` is invertible.

2.  Assume that `$A$` and `$B$` are `$n\times n$` matrices with `${\rm det} A = 3$` and `${\rm det} B = -2$`. Find the indicated determinants.

    a) `${\rm det} (A^2)$`

    b) `${\rm det} (B^{-1}A)$`

    c) `${\rm det} (2A)$`

    d) `${\rm det} (AA^T)$`

3. Prove that `${\rm det}(AB) = {\rm det}(BA)$`.

4. Use Cramer's Rule to solve the given linear system.

   a) `$ x + y = 1 $`, `$x-y = 2$`

   b) `$ x + y -z = 1 $`, `$ x+y+z =2$`, `$ x-y =3$`



5. Use Theorem 4.12 to compute the inverse of the coefficient matrix.

   a) `$A =  \left[\begin{array}{rr} 2 & -1 \\  1&3 \end{array}\right]$`

   b) `$A =  \left[\begin{array}{rrr} 2 & 1&3 \\ 0& 1&1 \\0&0&1 \end{array}\right]$`
	      

6.  Use the determinant version of the cross product to compute `${\bf u} \times {\bf v}$`. 

    a) `${\bf u} = \left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 1 \\0 \end{array}\right]$`,  `${\bf v} = \left[\begin{array}{r} 3 \\ -1 \\2 \end{array}\right]$`

    b) `${\bf u} = \left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 1 \\1 \end{array}\right]$`,  `${\bf v} = \left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{array}\right]$`

7.  If `${\bf u} = \left[\begin{array}{r} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{array}\right]$`, `${\bf v} = \left[\begin{array}{r} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{array}\right]$`, and `${\bf w} = \left[\begin{array}{r} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ w_3 \end{array}\right]$`, show that `$ {\bf u} \cdot ({\bf v} \times {\bf w}) = {\rm det} \left[\begin{array}{rrr} u_1 & v_1 & w_1 \\u_2 & v_2 & w_2 \\u_3 & v_3 & w_3 \end{array}\right].$`

8. Use properties of determinants (and Exercise 7, if necessary) to prove the given property of the cross product.

   a) `${\bf v } \times {\bf u}  = - ({\bf u} \times {\bf v})$`

   b) `${\bf u} \times {\bf u} = {\bf 0}$`

   c) `${\bf u} \cdot ({\bf u} \times {\bf v}) = 0$` and `${\bf v} \cdot ({\bf u} \times {\bf v}) = 0$` 








9. Read Lines and Planes on page 289. Prove that the three points `$(x_1, y_1)$`, `$(x_2, y_2)$` and `$(x_3,y_3)$` are collinear (lie on the same line) if and only if `$\left|\begin{array}{rrr} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{array} \right| = 0$`.


10. Read Curve Fitting on page 290. Use the method of Problem 15 to find the polynomial of degree at most `$2$` that passes through the following sets of points.

   a) `$A(1,-1)$`, `$B(2,4)$`, `$C(3,3)$`

   b) `$A(-1,-3)$`, `$B(1,-1)$`, `$C(3,1)$`

## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing than from an immediate explanation.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however it is a waste of time for everybody if you do not aim higher.
