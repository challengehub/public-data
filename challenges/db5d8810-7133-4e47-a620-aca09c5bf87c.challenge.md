title: Explaining the Cauchy-Riemann equations

---

## Comment
Note the distinction between "The equation being differentiable means X" and "X means the equation is differentiable".

## Challenge
Considering complex functions in the form `$f(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)$`, explain how the Cauchy-Riemann equations relate to differentiability at a point `$z_0$`.

*Note that a full derivation is not required, but an understanding of its implications is.*
