title: Explaining the Cauchy-Riemann equations

---

## Comment
Note the distinction between "The equation being differentiable means X" and "X means the equation is differentiable".

## Challenge
Considering complex functions in the form `$f(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)$`, explain what the Cauchy-Riemann equations are.
