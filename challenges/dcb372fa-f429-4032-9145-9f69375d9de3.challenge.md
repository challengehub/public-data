title: Writing complex numbers in the form a+ib

---

## Comments
Our first step is to make sure that there is no confusion when calculating with complex numbers.


## Challenge
Write the given numbers in the form `$a+ ib$`.

   a)  `$i(4-i) + 4i(1+2i)$`

   b) `$(2-3i)(4+i)$`

   c) `$\displaystyle \frac{2-4i}{3+5i}$`

   d) `$\displaystyle \frac{(4+5i)+2i^3}{(2+i)^2}$`

   e) `$\displaystyle (2+3i) \left(\frac{2-i}{1+2i}\right)^2$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan, chapter 1.1


## Solution Form
Please compare your solutions with you partner in class, and enter your solution for part (d) here.
If your answer is complex, in the form `$\alpha + i \beta$`, enter the number `$\alpha + \beta$`.
