## Comments
Our first step is to make sure that there is no confusion when calculating with complex numbers.


## Challenge
Write the given numbers in the form `$a+ ib$`.

   a)  `$i(4-i) + 4i(1+2i)$`

   b) `$(2-3i)(4+i)$`

   c) `$\displaystyle \frac{2-4i}{3+5i}$`

   d) `$\displaystyle \frac{(4+5i)+2i^3}{(2+i)^2}$`

   e) `$\displaystyle (2+3i) \left(\frac{2-i}{1+2i}\right)^2$`
