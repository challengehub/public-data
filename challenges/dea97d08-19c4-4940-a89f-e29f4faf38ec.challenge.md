## Challenge
Given that the saturated vapour pressure of water in the atmosphere at `$17^{\circ}\text{C}$` is `$0.01917~\text{bar}$`, considering a puddle of water at ground level exposed to the atmosphere at `$17^{\circ}\text{C}$`, calculate the **mass fraction of water** on the **liquid-side** of the water-air interface. You may assume that the average mass of air is `$29~\text{g}/\text{mol}$`.


## Resources

- Section **14.5.1** of *Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer* by F. Incropera et. al., 7th edition
