## Challenge
Determine the velocity `$v$` in question 4/28 in the book


## Resources
- Section 4/1 to 4/5 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution Form
You should obtain an algebraic expression for `$v$`. To check your expression, please apply the following values to the problem and enter your solution in m/s:
`$m_0=$` 1 kg
`$v_0=$` 1000 m/s
`$b=$` 1.5 m
`$m=$` 4 kg
