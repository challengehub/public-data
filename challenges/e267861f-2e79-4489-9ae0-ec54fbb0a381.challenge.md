## Challenge
Express `$|z+ 5\overline z|$`  in terms of `$x$` and `$y$` for `$z = x + iy$`

## Resources
- Chapter 1 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/imaginary-and-complex-numbers#the-complex-plane)

## Solution Form
To check your answer, substitute `$x=2$` and `$y=3$`.
If your answer is complex, in the form `$\alpha + i \beta$`, enter the number `$\alpha + \beta$`.
