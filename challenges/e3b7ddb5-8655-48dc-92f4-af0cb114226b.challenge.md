title: Calculating the complex roots of (1+i)^(1/5)

---

## Comment
Let us make sure that everybody understands why the equation `$w^n = z$` has  exactly `$n$` solutions and how to find them. Here, `$n$` is a positive integer.

## Challenge
Compute the principal root and `$n$`th root of the following expression and sketch the roots `$w_0,w_1, \dots, w_{n-1}$` on an appropriate circle centered at the origin:
  
`$$(1+i)^\frac15$$`
