## Comments

To see that complex numbers are not just a figment of an unsound mind take a look at the following basic applications.

## Challenge

1.  Express the given complex number in the exponential form `$z = r e^{i \theta}$`.

    a) `$-2\pi i$`
    b) `$(3-i)^2$`
    c) `$\frac{2}{1+i}$`
    
2. Find solutions of the given homogeneous differential equation. 
 
    a) `$ 3y'' + 2y' + y = 0 $`

    b) `$y'' + 2y' + 4y = 0 $`
    
3.
