## Comments

To see that complex numbers are not just a figment of an unsound mind take a look at the following basic applications.

## Challenge

1.  Express the given complex number in the exponential form `$z = r e^{i \theta}$`.

    a) `$-2\pi i$`
    b) `$(3-i)^2$`
    c) `$\frac{2}{1+i}$`
    
2. Find solutions of the given homogeneous differential equation. 
 
    a) `$ 3y'' + 2y' + y = 0 $`

    b) `$y'' + 2y' + 4y = 0 $`
    
3. If `$z_1$` is a root of a polynomial equation with *real* coefficients, then its conjugate `$z_2 = \overline z_1$` is also a root. Prove this result in the case of a quadratic equation `$az^2 + bz + c = 0 $`, where `$a \neq   0$`, `$b$` and `$c$` are real. Use the properties of complex conjugates.

4. If `$z_1$` is a root of a polynomial equation with *nonreal* coefficients, then its conjugate `$z_2 =\overline z_1$` is not necessarily a root. Prove this resula in the case of a quadratic equation `$az^2 + bz + c = 0 $`, where at least one fo the coefficients `$a\neq 0$`, `$b$` or `$c$` is not real.


## Resources

- Check the textbook.
 
- Go back to previous challenges.

- Explore  the Internet.

## Tips

- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
