## Challenge
Answer question 7/27 in the book by:

1. Considering the axes fixed and not rotating with the shaft.

2. Considering the axes rotating with the shaft. In this case, you will need to consider the velocity components of the axes themselves as well as the velocity component induced by the swinging of the pendulum, using the derivative chain rule.

## Resources
- Section 5/7 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition
- Section 7/1 to 7/5 of Engineering Mechanics Dynamics by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9cc7sSm_g

*Correction to book: Figure 7/9 should read `$\bm{\alpha} = \bm{\dot{\omega}} = \bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{\omega}$` (not `$\bm{\Omega} \bm{\times} \bm{r}$`)*


## Solution Form
The solution is given in the book and you should obtain the same answer in both cases.
