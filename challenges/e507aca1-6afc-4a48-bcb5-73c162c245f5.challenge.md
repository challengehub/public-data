## Challenge
Answer question **7/65** in the book.
Note that the question only concerns the cone, and not the cone-rod system.

## Resources
- Secion **7/7** and **7/8** of *Engineering Mechanics Dynamics* by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution form
The solution is given in the book, but there is a mistake. The solution for angular momentum should read
`$$
\bm{H}_O = \frac{3}{10} m r^2 \left[ \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2 h^2}{r^2} \right) \Omega \hat{i} + p \hat{k} \right]
$$`
