## Comments

After introducing analyticity and its basic properties it is time to get to know some analytic functions that are common in calculations. They are all complex "extensions" of  well known real elementary functions like exponential, logarithm, powers, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions with their inverses. However, as we will see the complex versions are much more ... well "complex" than the real ones and care has to be taken while evaluating them. We begin by learning their complex definitions and how to evaluate them.






## Challenge

1.  Find all the complex values.

    a) `$\ln{i}$`
    
    b) `$\ln{(1-i)}$`
    

2. Write in the form `$a + ib$`.
    
  a) `${\rm Ln}(-i)$`
    
  b) `$\operatorname{Ln}(-1-i)$`
    
  c) `$\operatorname{Ln}((1+i)^6)$`


3. Find all the complex values.
    
    a) `$i^i$`

    b) `$3^i$`
    
4. Write the principal value in the form `$a + ib$`.    

    a) `$(-1)^i$`
    
    b) `$(1 - \sqrt{3}i)^i$`
    
    c) `$i^{\displaystyle\frac{i}\pi}$`
    
5. Write in the form `$a + ib$`.

   a) `$\sin{i}$`
   
   b) `$\cos{i}$`
   
   c) `$\sinh{i}$`
   
   d) `$\cosh{i}$`
   
   
6. Using the definitions prove that:

   a) `$\sinh{(iz)} = i\sinh{z} $`
   
   b) `$\cosh{(iz)} = \cosh{z} $`

7. Find all the complex values.

   a) `$\sin^{-1}\sqrt{2}$`
   
   b) `$\cos^{-1}{i}$`
   
   c) `$\sinh^{-1}{i}$`
   
   d) `$\cosh^{-1}{\frac12}$`

- Explore the Internet.


## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing that from  explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
