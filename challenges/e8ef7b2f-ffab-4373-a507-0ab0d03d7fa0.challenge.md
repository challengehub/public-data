## Comments
Until now we have been considering Fourier series. This is however limited to describing periodic phenomena since it is assumed that the signal repeats outside the region of integration. The Fourier transform can be thought of as an extension of Fourier series which allows the analysis of non-periodic phenomena.

I strongly recommend to view the 3B1B video first, followed by the Stanford videos (supported by the book). The 3B1B video gives an excellent intuition into what the Fourier Transform is, and then the Stanford material gives a different, more traditional mathematical explanation. Although they of course both arrive at the same result, it is beneficial to see this from both perspectives.

## Challenge
By referring to the excellent resources given here, show how to make the transition from Fourier series to the Fourier transform.


## Resources
