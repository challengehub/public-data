## Terminology 

- `$n$`th root
- principal `$n$`th root


## Comments

Let us make sure that everybody understands why the equation `$w^n = z$` has  exactly `$n$` solutions and how to find them. Here, `$n$` is a positive integer.


## Challenge


1.  Compute all roots. Give the principal `$n$`th root in each case. Sketch the roots `$w_0,w_1, \dots, w_{n-1}$` on an appropriate circle centered at the origin.
  
  a) `$(8)^\frac13$`

    b) `$(1+i)^\frac15$`

    c) `$\displaystyle \left(\frac{16i}{1+i}\right)^\frac18$`

2. Find all solutions to the equation `$z^4 + 1 = 0$`.
3. Find a general formula for `$n$`th root of the unity. Find `$n$` `$n$`th roots of the unity for `$n= 3$`, `$n= 5$` and plot the roots in the complex plane. 

4. For a fixed `$n$` it is easy to verify that `$w_n = \cos \frac{2\pi}n + i \sin \frac{2\pi}n$` is an `$n$`th root of unity. Explain why the `$n$` `$n$`th roots of the unity can be written as `$1, w_n, w_n ^2, \dots, w_n^{n-1}$`.

- Check the textbook.

- Explore the Internet.


## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing that from explanation by others.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however you should always aim higher.
