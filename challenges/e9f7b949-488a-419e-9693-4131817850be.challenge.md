## Challenge
Consider a gas stream flowing above a liquid. Species *A* has a mole fraction of `$0.5$` in the liquid while species *B* has a mole fraction of `$0.005$` in the liquid.

**a)** For which species is Henry's law most applicable?

**b)** Calculate Henry's constant for the gas where Henry's law is most applicable, if the partial pressure of both species in the gas stream is `$0.5~\text{bar}$`.


## Resources

- Section **14.5.2** of *Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer* by F. Incropera et. al., 7th edition


## Solution Form
**a)** Please compare your answer with your partner

**b)** Please enter your solution in units of *bar*. Enter only the number, not the units.
