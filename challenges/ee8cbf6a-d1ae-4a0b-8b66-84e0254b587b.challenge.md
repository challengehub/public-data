## Challenge
Considering the following integrals, show under what conditions the following integrals evaluate to zero, and what condition they don't evaluate to zero.
What is the non-zero evaluation result?

`$$\int_0^1 \sin(2 \pi m t) \sin(2 \pi n t) dt$$`

`$$\int_0^1 \cos(2 \pi m t) \cos(2 \pi n t) dt$$`

You may assume that `$m$` and `$n$` are non-zero positive integers.
