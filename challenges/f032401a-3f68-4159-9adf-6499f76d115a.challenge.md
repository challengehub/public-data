## Intro

After the previous challenge we already know what vector space and subspace are. In this challenge we will show that the ideas like (spanning set, linear independence, basis, dimension, coordinates or change of basis matrix) that worked so nicely in `$\mathbb R^n$` work equally well in general vector spaces and subspaces. 


## Terminology

- span, spanning set, `$V$` spanned by `$S$`
- linearly dependent, linearly independent
- basis, standard basis
- coordinates with respect to a basis, coordinate vector
- finite-dimensional, dimension, infinite-dimensional
- change of basis matrix

 

## Theorems

- span of vectors is a subspace
- equivalent condition to linear independence
- basis provides a unique set of coordinates for each vector
- coordinates are linear transformation
- linear independence of vectors and of their coordinates are equivalent
- the Basis Theorem 
- dimension of subspace
- everything we learned about change of basis matrix in `$\mathbb R^n$` works here too


## Key points


- the ideas of span, linear independence and basis work the same as in `$\mathbb R^n$`
- `$\mathbb R^n$` is just a famous example of vector space
- coordinates help us to describe a vector space using `$\mathbb R^n$`
- coordinates are linear transformation and hence preserve linear independence
- dimension is based on the unique number of vectors in a basis
- change of basis matrices are related to coordinates and hence work the same as before

## Tips


- You learn more from trying and failing than from an immediate explanation.

- Find and solve as many exercises as YOU need to become proficient.

- Required minimum must be set, however it is a waste of time for everybody if you do not aim higher.
