## Comments
Note that the video resource uses `$n$` to denote the `$n$`'th sample of the period and `$k$` to represent the `$k$`'th DFT coefficient.


## Challenge
Using the butterfly diagram of an 8-point sampled signal, show that the the number of multiplications is consistent with the notion that the fast Fourier transform scales as `$N log N$`.
