## Intro

When a function  `$f$` fails to be analytic at a point `$z_0$` we can not expand it into a power series centered at `$z_0$`. However, as we will see in this challenge, not everything is lost. The function `$f$` can be expanded into a more general "power series" called a **Laurent Series** of `$f$` about `$z_0$`.  

## Terminology

- singularity, singular point
- isolated vs nonisolated singularity
- principal and analytic part of a Laurent series
- Laurent series, Laurent expansion



## Theorems

- Laurent's Theorem
- Laurent's series on a specific annular domain is unique
- methods for finding Laurent's series



## Comments

Expansion into Laurent series needs a good knowledge of geometric series and  expansion into power series. 


## Challenge

1. Expand `$\displaystyle f(z) = \frac1{z(z-3)}$` in a Laurent series  valid for the given annular domain.

   a)  `$0 < |z|<3$`
   
   b) `$3<|z|$`
   
   c) `$0 < |z-3|<3$`
   
   d) `$3<|z-3|$`
   
   e) `$1 < |z+1|<4$`
   
2. Expand `$\displaystyle{f(z)=\frac{z-3}{(z-1)(z+1)}}$` in a Laurent series  valid for the given annular domain. 

    a) `$|z| < 1$`
    
    b) `$|z| > 1$`

3. The function `$\displaystyle f(z)= \frac1{(z+2)(z-4i)}$` possesses a Laurent series `$\displaystyle f(z)= \sum_{k= - \infty}^\infty a_k (z+2)^k$` valid  in the annulus  `$r < |z+2| < R$`. What are `$r$` and `$R$`?
