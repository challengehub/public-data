## Comments
Another important concept is amplitude. `$\sin(2 \pi t)$` has an amplitude of 1, but this can be easily modified to go between `$\pm A$` by multiplication with `$A$`.

To achieve the learning aims of this challenge, try to do it without the assistance of digital equipment, just like in an exam.


## Challenge
The following 4 graphs correspond to the equation `$A \sin(2 \pi k t)$` with variation in the values of `$A$` and `$k$`. What is the sum of the values of `$A$` for the following graphs?

## Solution Form
Enter the sum as an integer to check your answer.
