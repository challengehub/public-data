## Comment
The equation
`$$
x(t) = \frac{2 F}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)} \sin \left( \frac{\omega_0 - \omega}{2} t \right) \sin \left( \frac{\omega_0 + \omega}{2} t \right)
$$`
demonstrates the phenomenon of beating. You have a high-frequency wave multiplied by a low frequency wave when `$\omega$` and `$\omega_0$` differ only slightly. The image in the above resource depicts this visually very nicely and you can also hear a representation of this in sound with the video resource above.

## Challenge
Draw a graph depicting what happens as time evolves, and briefly explain what "beating" is and how it arises.
