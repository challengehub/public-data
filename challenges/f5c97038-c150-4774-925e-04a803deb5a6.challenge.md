title: Derivation of a periodically-forced harmonically vibrating system

---

## Challenge
Now consider that there is some external forcing of the form `$F \cos \omega t$` on a harmonic spring, where `$F$` is some constant. Note that `$\omega$` is the frequency at which the forcing varies, and `$\omega_0^2 = k/m$` is the "natural frequency" of the unforced system.

With the condition that `$\omega \ne \omega_0$`, show that the position of the forced system as a function of time can be given by
`$$
    x(t) = C_3 \cos(\omega_0 t - \phi) + \frac{F}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)} \cos \omega t
$$`
