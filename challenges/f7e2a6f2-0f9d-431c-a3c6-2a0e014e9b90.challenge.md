## Challenge
Considering question **7/73** in the book, calculate the moment of inertia about the base `$I_{xz}$` for one of the rods, treating the z-axis as the vertical axis and the x-axis spanning the distance between the rods. Note that you need to treat the origin of the system as being on the axis of rotation.


## Resources
- Section **7/9** of *Engineering Mechanics Dynamics* by Meriam and Kraig, 6th Edition


## Solution form
To check your answer, substitute any of the following values into your final equation.
Your solution should have units of `$\text{kg}/\text{m}^2$`, but only enter the number, not the units.

- `$b = 1~\text{m}$`
- `$m = 2~\text{kg}$`
- `$l = 1.5~\text{m}$`
