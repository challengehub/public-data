## Comments
The PDF listed in the resources is based on slides developed by Prof. Maraso Yamashiro for the 2015 class on Fourier Analysis. Please work through the slides on the following pages and view the video afterwards.


## Challenge
1. An audio CD can record frequencies up to 44.1 kHz. Consider how often you would need to sample a sound in order to reproduce frequencies up to 44.1 kHz. What is the highest sampling frequency that experiences aliasing?

2. Write a sentence or two summarising aliasing and the Nyquist sampling theorem.
