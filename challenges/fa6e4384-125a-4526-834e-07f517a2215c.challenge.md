## Challenge
Suppose `$z_0$` is any constant complex number interior to any simple closed curve contour `$C$`. Show that for any  integer `$n\in \mathbb Z$` (including both negative and positive numbers and the number 0):
 `$$\oint_C \frac{dz}{(z-z_0)^n} =  \left \{\begin{array}{cl} 2\pi i & n= 1 \\ 0 & n \ne 1 .\end{array} \right.$$`
