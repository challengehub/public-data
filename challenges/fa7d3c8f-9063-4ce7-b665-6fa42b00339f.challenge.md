## Intro

Integration of complex functions was no fun so far since integrating real and imaginary parts separately can be a cumbersome work. In this challenge we find out when we can use an analogue of the fundamental theorem of calculus for complex integration.



## Terminology

- independence of the path
- `$\displaystyle \int_C f(z) dz$` vs `$\displaystyle \int_{z_0}^{z_1} f(z)dz$`
- antiderivative/indefinite integral of a complex function




## Theorems

- analyticity implies path independence
- Fundamental Theorem for Contour Integrals
- integral over a closed contour of a function with antiderivative is equal to zero
- integral of a function with antiderivative is independent of path
- continuous functions with path independent integrals have antiderivative
- integration by parts for complex functions





## Comments

We find interesting relations between analyticity, integral path independence and antiderivatives. Pay close attention to these relations as they are not equivalent. Moreover be careful when  using antiderivatives of non-entire functions, we discussed branch cuts for a good reason. In other words, always make sure the conditions are satisfied before applying the conclusion of a theorem!   


## Challenge

1. Evaluate the given integral along the indicated closed contour.

   a)  `$\displaystyle{\int_{C} e^z} \ dz$`, where `$C:z(t)=3t^2+i(t^4+t^2+1), \hspace{.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq 1$`
   
   b) `$\displaystyle{\int_{C} iz^3 - z} \ dz$`, where `$C:z(t)=\displaystyle{\frac{4t+2i-2it}{1+t^2}}, \hspace{.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq 1$`
   
   c) `$\displaystyle{\int_{C} z^2} \ dz$`, where `$C$` is the right half of the circle `$z(t)=5e^{it}$` from `$z=-5$` to `$z=5i$`
   
   d) `$\displaystyle{\int_C 2z+1} \ dz$`, where `$C$` is the contour ![path](/api/v0/teachers/github.cbal-brezina/resources/public/3a3bcb47-e2ad-452c-8f46-c14e230fb7c9.png/3a3bcb47-e2ad-452c-8f46-c14e230fb7c9.png)
