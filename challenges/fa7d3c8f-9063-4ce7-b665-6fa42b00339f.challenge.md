## Intro

Integration of analytic functions over simple closed contours is quite easy!



## Terminology

- simply connected domains
- multiply (doubly, triply) connected domains 
- principle of deformation of contours
 



## Theorems

- Cauchy-Goursat Theorem
  a) simply connected domain
  b) multiply connected domains






## Comments

Thanks to Cauchy-Goursat Theorem we see that many complex integrals are equal to zero or that we can take a simpler contour to calculate a complex integral over a closed contour. In the next challenge we will more useful results following from the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem. Cauchy Goursat Theorem holds for any  closed contour in a simply connected domain, i.e., the contour need not to be simple!


## Challenge

1. Evaluate the given integral along the indicated closed contour.

   a)  `$\displaystyle{\oint_C z^2 + 1} \ dz$`, where `$C = 3+e^{it}, \hspace{0.3cm} 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$`
   
   b) `$\displaystyle{\oint_C z + \frac{1}{z}} \ dz$`, where `$C : |z|=2$`
   
   c) `$\displaystyle{\oint_C \frac{3z+i}{z^2+1}}\  dz$`, where `$C : |z-i|=1$`
   
   d) `$\displaystyle{\oint_C \frac{3z+i}{z^2+1}} \ dz$`, where `$C : |z+i|=1$`
   
   e) `$\displaystyle{\oint_C \frac{3z+i}{z^2+1}} \ dz$`, where `$C : |z|=2$`
   
   f) `$\displaystyle{\oint_C \frac{2z+3}{z^2-z}} \ dz$`, where `$C$` is the contour

2. Suppose `$z_0$` is any constant complex number interior to any simple closed curve contour `$C$`. Show that for any  `$n\in \mathbb N$`
 `$$\displaystyle \oint_C \frac{dz}{(z-z_0)^n } =  \left\{\begin{array}{cl} 2\pi i & n= 1 \\ 0 & n = \not 1 .\end{array}\right.$$`
