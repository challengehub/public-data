## Comments
Here we can learn about an application of Fourier series to solve partial differential equations. This problem was one of the motivations for Fourier to develop the idea of Fourier series.

The motivation for the equation `$u_t = \frac{1}{2} u_{xx}$` described in the notes is complicated somewhat by the interpretation in terms of equivalences between electrical and thermal capacitance. If this is not so clear then don't worry about it. At a minimum you should understand the following:

- Heat flow is proportional to the gradient of the temperature.
- Heat accumulates within a unit volume when the rate of heat flow into that volume is greater than the rate of heat flow out of that volume.

## Challenge
The following statements concern a heated ring with circumference 1 and temperature distribution described by `$u(x,t)$`. Add the points of the statements that are defined by the system to be true:

**1 point**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t)$`

**2 points**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t+1)$`

**4 points**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t+2)$`

**8 points**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t)$`

**16 points**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t+1)$`

**32 points**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t+2)$`

**64 points**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t)$`

**128 points**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t+1)$`

**256 points**: `$\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t+2)$`

**512 points**: The temperature distribution is periodic in space but not time

**1024 points**: The temperature distribution is periodic in time but not space

**2048 points**: The temperature distribution is periodic in both space and time

**4096 points**: The temperature distribution is periodic neither in space nor time
