## Comments

Linear functions are the easiest type of functions to visualize in complex plane. On the other hand, they play a crucial role in the concept of limit and differentiation. We will be working with them a lot and hence a good understanding of them is a *must*. 

## Challenge
Find a linear mapping in the form `$f(z)=\dots$` that maps the set `$S$` onto the set `$S'$`.
Here, `$S$` is the square with vertices `$1+i, -1+i, -1-i, 1-i$`
and `$S'$` is the square with vertices `$1, 2+i, 1+2i, i$`.

## Resources
    
- Chapter 2 of *A first course in complex analysis with applications* by D. Zill and P. Shanahan


## Solution Form
To check your solution, calculate `$f(z=2i)$`.
You will obtain a solution `$a+ib$`.
Enter `$b$` to check your solution.
