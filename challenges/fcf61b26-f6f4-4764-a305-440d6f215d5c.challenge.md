## Challenge
Given that `$v(t)$` satisfies the relation `$v' = g - v^2$`, assuming an initial value of `$v(0)=0$`, using Euler's method estimate `$v(1)$` using step sizes of

1. `$\Delta t = 1/2$`
2. `$\Delta t = 1/4$`

Referring to the slope-field graph of this equation, explain the significant difference in the behaviour with the different step sizes. It may be helpful to draw a graph.

## Solution Form
Please compare your explanation with your partner in class. To check your calculation, calculate `$\alpha+\beta$` where
`$\alpha$` is your solution when `$\Delta t = 1/2$` and
`$\beta$` is your solution when `$\Delta t = 1/4$`.
