title: Calculate the Laurent Series of 1/(z(z-3)) for the annular domain 3<|z|

---

## Comment
The video in the resources below is really good and provides a clearer walk-through of the technique than the book.

## Challenge
Expand `$\displaystyle f(z) = \frac1{z(z-3)}$` in a Laurent series valid for the annular domain `$3<|z|$`. Show that the resulting Laurent series can be written as

`$$f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{3^n}{a_{(z,n)}}$$`

where `$a_{(z,n)}$` is a number dependent on `$z$` and `$n$`.
