## Challenge
Consider a mass on a spring undergoing harmonic vibration with no damping or external forcing as shown in the picture here: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/imgmec/hook.gif

Show that the position of the mass as a function of time can be given by

`$$
x(t) = C_1 \sin \omega_0 t + C_2 \cos \omega_0 t
$$`

where `$C_1$` and `$C_2$` are constants.
